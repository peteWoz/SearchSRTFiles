1
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,830
You know where the islands of the

2
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:29,400
plastics are floating? They have a certain,
set pattern, yeah? And Jallal just showed that,

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:38,899
when he puts CH3 or Deuterium, the
plastic has the way to go towards it. So,

4
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:45,450
that rang a bell in my head when you use
Deuterium, I said then there must be

5
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:52,469
something going on deeper in the crust
of the Earth, because Deuterium has

6
00:00:52,469 --> 00:01:03,979
decayed. So, I said maybe that might be
related to the magma or volcanic high

7
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:08,640
movement.
I said, maybe it will even match, where

8
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,810
Mr. Keshe was explaining about the
earthquakes and the snapping of the

9
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:20,009
plates. So, now we try to bring it into a
map, and I said if anyone can find

10
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,750
anything what is shown above these
fields - that might explain why the

11
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,520
plastics are held in place, or they're
moving together - from one part to the

12
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,540
other - in more dense concentration. I said,
we were nearly about preparing

13
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,799
everything to come off for Thursday, I
said, but I said it might be good to

14
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,149
invite Mr. Keshe, maybe we'll receive some
more answers. So, they all have agreed to

15
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:56,909
invite you here. So, if you can share it
again. There it is. Can you see it Mr.

16
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,410
Keshe?

17
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:10,070
He even has moving, or rotating, life
rotating, that the plastic - how it travels

18
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:16,310
from one point to another. These are the
concentration points. Annie can you show

19
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:42,560
the other one, please? I might get broken
off because we have a very bad internet

20
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,070
today in China. All the VPNs are
shutting down very rapidly, because

21
00:02:49,070 --> 00:03:28,239
there's some problems. (CK) I'm getting cut off, because I'm getting... You found it Vernie? (inaudible). Am I correct with the assumption that

22
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:35,720
something decay is going on deeper in, to
attract these huge islands or masses of

23
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:45,350
plastic to stay in position and move
together? (MK) It's internal field forces which

24
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:55,730
matches. (CK) Yeah, but if it's Deuterium,
plastic is not Deuterium. (MK) This is not a

25
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:11,660
Deuterium, this is a C-H bond.
Even Deuterium is a H3 plasma condition.

26
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:18,180
(CK) So, what is going on...
(MK) It's a... What happened, you have a deuterium,

27
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,710
when you call it the H2. But it doesn't neccessarily
behave as H2, it behaves as H3.

28
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:40,580
All the plastics have some sort of a CH3
bond, or CH bond. This is where most of

29
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:49,229
protein is gathering, most probably. And
if you look at it, if you look at the map.

30
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:58,979
If he can put what was up before? If you
can't put it up? Can somebody? Can we have

31
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:10,580
the picture, which was there before - the
two circles? You see. Can you open it up?

32
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:28,689
If you can open that up. These are, most of
these, what we know...

33
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:35,490
Hello, can you hear me? (CK) Yes, yes.

34
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:45,870
(MK) I had a problem here with my system.
(CK) But if you look from the right side, go to the right circle, it's like

35
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:55,590
in one line, around the planet. (MK) Yeah, but
these are. Just one second, I have to give

36
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:34,050
an answer. You see, when you... Where is it?
Where have I lost the Zoom? Hello? (CK) We are still there, Mr Keshe. (MK) I don't have a...

37
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:56,040
(CK) Can you see the screen? (J) I think he want to
annotate. (MK) No, there's something wrong with

38
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:09,570
the picture. Can you move it up? Can we see
the both circles, please? (VG) This one is, this

39
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:17,310
one is the first side, showing the
Pacific Ocean. The other one is showing

40
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:27,960
the Atlantic Ocean. (MK) Yeah, we want to see the
Atlantic ocean, please. If you...

41
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:36,120
Okay. If you look at these two, the all
four of them, these are what we call the

42
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:44,030
protein lines. These are where
most of.... If you bring all the pictures

43
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,710
down together. These are where most of the
protein lines are produced,

44
00:07:50,710 --> 00:08:01,300
where we see majority of the fishes. And what....
You see, where you see in the West Africa,

45
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:09,980
that area, and where you see the North
China Sea, and the same in the south side.

46
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,730
Can you expand this picture? Okay, just
wait. If you look at all these pictures,

47
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:21,440
these are what we call a protein line,
which is where we see most of the fishes,

48
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:30,620
and this is where the carbon-hydrogen
bond stays. When you look at something a

49
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:43,070
lot of people don't know is... If you look
at, if you look at... There is something

50
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:56,060
wrong with my phone. If you look at the
African side, for example, just where you

51
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:03,290
see in the West Africa - north of what you
call it, the West of north of South

52
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:18,170
Africa. And then you go across to what we
call Amazon. This is where all the Sahara

53
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:25,910
dust comes. And if there wasn't a Sahara
dust coming annually, right across

54
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:34,850
Atlantic into Amazon, Amazon would have
been dead. So, what you see, we see what is

55
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:40,730
known as a protein line. We see the same
thing in North Atlantic and

56
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,220
on the Pacific
side. Where you see on the Pacific with

57
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:54,490
the red lines, when you look at it, in
what you call

58
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,350
California side, to the other side - you see a lot of these. These are where

59
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:05,709
South China Sea comes in and brings a
lot of life into the ocean. So, there's a

60
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:15,940
CH bond, which is a protein bond and they
get attracted to it. And they are part

61
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:24,580
of the way you do it in your CO2 box,
literally. They are connected.

62
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:30,670
We looked at this some times ago. This is
what, if you see it is in line and it

63
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:44,610
goes across South America, Brazil into,
what we call, jungles of

64
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:56,080
Brazil and it goes across because it's
very thin. All these and the North, is the

65
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:04,209
same, comes from North China Sea.
This we know and is a characteristics

66
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:13,959
of the protein absorption. Yes we can see
it, because... It's very eas.y If you look at

67
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:26,020
the West Africa - the one in the middle. I
cannot, I cannot. There are two-three

68
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,820
reasons what they get, they gather here. If
you look at the West Africa, it comes

69
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:38,800
down through South Atlantic and it
covers the Amazons, and then it goes

70
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,570
across. This is a protein lin,e this is
where we see most of the fishes. The same when you

71
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:55,570
look, is a what you call, Pacific, North
Atlantic. It's the same. These are the

72
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:04,089
feeding lines. If you look at the North
Atlantic and you see the other end of it

73
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:15,149
is where you get a lot...
We understand partially what this is, but

74
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:23,140
de-concentration of it. So, is
connected with the central, magnetic,

75
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:36,970
gravitational fields and... What... If they
were collected in one group, one place, in

76
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:47,579
one ocean, you would have said is that
place. But it's like a crust and these

77
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:53,860
plastics we don't see them to
disintegrate. They stay in the salt water

78
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:01,029
the way they are. And there are some reports
that are very fatty, that they are not

79
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:09,430
normal. And partially why we think the
animals, a lot of fishes are eating

80
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:19,390
plastic. Because these plastics through their...
They are in the salt water, so they

81
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:30,070
taste, they behave like protein. We know
animals - if they eat something wrong, they

82
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:40,000
spit it out, all the fishes do. But they
swallow it, because is tented

83
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,120
with a protein. We looked at a lot of
this, how the animals... Somebody's

84
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:58,019
microphone is open. And this is, this, we... There is a behavior to this, is...

85
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:07,089
First of all it has a connection, CH
bonds with a protein, and it's on a feed

86
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:16,420
line - we see there are protein ocean
line.

87
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,040
The North American, North Atlantic you
have the same. The Pacific you have the

88
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:31,450
same. And it is very, very easy. Especially
if you look at South America and it

89
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:37,990
goes right across the other position, and
if you aligned it, you will see lies

90
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:48,310
within the structure. These are places
where most of the fish, heavy fishes are

91
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:56,470
found too. Not the fish as, what we call
the omibs - the origin of life. We

92
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:06,399
seen it in Australia and the... what they call it,
the South Africa. These are heavy ocean

93
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:15,519
lines. Now we understand this is
partially the reason. And if you go back

94
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:28,380
to the teachings, many times I explained.
That's... if you.... I don't have my pen with me,

95
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:39,240
it's on my desk. If you look for example, the
red sand from Africa, Central Africa

96
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:49,440
comes over
it covers usually Gambia. Comes to

97
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,660
Sierra Leon and it comes down. If you stay
on the street you go read. It's happened

98
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:02,730
to me many times. And then it goes over
the Atlantic, and it goes all the way to

99
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:16,510
what we will call the... all the
jungles, which we see. And they say most

100
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:25,970
of the oxygen of the world is produced
in these jungles, which is all rubbish -

101
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:31,370
now we know. And then the rest of it
carries on across, because that part of

102
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:38,990
South America is very thin. And
then it goes into, what we call, Atlantic

103
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:47,360
till about Indian Ocean on the other side - if
you look at it that away. And this line

104
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:59,720
we know, we can't follow it. What you call
the jungles of Brazil, or southern

105
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:13,100
America, receives estimated, in the region
of 140 million tons of sand from

106
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:20,870
Central Africa every year. And in that
process the rest of it lies exactly as

107
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:28,429
we see across continents and it
goes across the continents through to the

108
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:35,860
other side. And we have the same kind of
process coming through, what we call,

109
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:47,240
Australia to southern African continent. The

110
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:59,360
Sahara is, they, if you think. So much,
there are 250 million tons of sand comes off

111
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:11,600
the Central Africa, all the way across to
Atlantic; over what you call all

112
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,420
the jungles of Amazon and everything going
through to the other side across. Where

113
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,170
does all this sand comes from?

114
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:27,140
And it happens every year. We have
descenting North China Sea, as you see, in the

115
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,710
North North Pacific, which goes to America.
There are some of these sandstorms

116
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:41,480
are visible, some of them gets watched
through the operation of the, what we

117
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:48,140
call, the icebergs. When in the snow time it
comes from Canada, or it comes from

118
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:54,650
North China. They create this line, we
know these lines very clearly. And if you

119
00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:01,850
look and consider how many millions of
tons of sand, for centuries is going

120
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:09,310
across, or in the north part. Where does
the sand come from? So, the Earth attracts

121
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:15,200
these sand particles from the
atmosphere. As much as it releases every

122
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:22,550
year, we don't see a dip in the desert. We
don't see them running out of sand. The

123
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:30,500
way the atmosphere produces a protein;
from atmosphere into the sea, and then

124
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:38,750
ends of it down rains on the fish - the same
thing happens with the desert. And in

125
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:44,420
that process, it creates a gravitational-
magnetic field of the sand. And then the

126
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:51,530
gold and that kind of things, all can
come through this. So, the plastics now

127
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:57,680
have become those sands coming from the
sky. Because of the gravitational

128
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:06,410
magnetic field of the below, they get
attracted to the same positions. They get

129
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:16,670
pulled to it - it is the magnetic field
created by it, by the proteins. We don't

130
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,800
see them anywhere else, we see the
majority on the protein line. And if

131
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:29,690
you look in West Africa, you have the
most richest regions of the fish, because

132
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,340
they go there to eat. All the big fishes
go to have their aminos

133
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:39,880
from the...The sand from Sahara has a lot
of iron. Mixture with a protein creates

134
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,120
life - the first phase of life with the sugar
and salt in the water; and the

135
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:55,600
beginning of the planktons.
And then the planktons are purely amino

136
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,020
acid mixture with iron from the Sahara.

137
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:07,930
Som we understand this and it's just
attached to it, because these plastics

138
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:17,320
are originally made from the protein-
based petroleum, or gases, which is the

139
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:24,250
same base so they get attracted to it. We
have made material, which the magnetic

140
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:37,390
fields of the planet matches to. Now we
understand. It is very easy to get rid of

141
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:44,950
these plastics in the oceans through the
Keshe Foundation technology. It is rather

142
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:51,370
easy, so it's part of the program we have
in China, is this. But it cannot be done.

143
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,530
There is something, which I was
explaining to some powerful

144
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:07,660
diplomats today and yesterday. That
is we have the solution, but we don't

145
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:17,560
have the production. If the production is
achieved, we can reach some 300 factories

146
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,420
in the next 20 years, around, enough
factories, industrial zones. We can get

147
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:32,710
rid of a lot of things. We have done some
tests. 90% of the

148
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:47,150
oceans, what you call them,
we see them getting destroyed now. All

149
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:57,950
the lives - we see it by Australia. We see
it by most of the South Pacific and

150
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:04,730
South Atlantic. They're losing all the
prostrations, which is taken centuries and

151
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:10,720
thousands of years to build up. The
seashells they're dying because of the,

152
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:30,370
they say it's CO2. This... we have found the
reversal for it. When you look all the...

153
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:36,530
(CK) The corals, you mean? (MK) Coral reefs, coral reefs - partially yes. We
have found the solution for them, they don't

154
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:44,870
need to go gray. There is a
solution we can just add in the

155
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:53,930
environment of them and corals come back
to life. They just chang the condition.

156
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:57,170
We can change the same with the
plastics.

157
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:03,290
We have done a lot of research, there is a lot of
solutions. We have found a lot things can

158
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:12,170
be done. But, we don't have the production
and that's why we're involved in. I was

159
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:19,240
with some diplomats, they are trying to get them
to join the Keshe Foundation as a nation,

160
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:26,360
to to be part of this program this
afternoon. (CK) I have a very strange question

161
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:38,420
for you Mr. Keshe. (MK) Yes Mrs. Keshe. (CK) You know, for still a while people will
still be abusing plastic, and plastic will

162
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:46,340
be rolling off the production line. What
if we can add to our shops... I don't know if

163
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:55,750
it's possible, it's just something I just,Ncame to my mind. Can we sell

164
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:04,559
like production kit, that people can then
apply their plastic integration at home?

165
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:13,720
Like... (MK) You see we are finding a lot of use for plastic bottles

166
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:22,529
and plastic bags. It's amazing what we
are finding. If we use, when we use

167
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:34,389
plastic bottles in farming, we get a
beautiful result. This year we have nearly

168
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:45,070
100.000 square meter, actually
250,000 square meter, under cultivation,

169
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:53,820
and we are testing with plastic bottles.
And the farmers are going crazy with it. We

170
00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:04,179
expect anything between three to six
times harvest. Because, once we create the

171
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:12,940
condition - a specific way of GaNSes in
the bottles, the CH bond of the bottle

172
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,570
itself, it becomes a source of fields.

173
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:26,409
Because, if you consider... you put GaNSes
in two bottles and just think they're okay

174
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:36,700
50 meters apart, 100 meters apart. or
whatever. Now in reality, the structure of

175
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,070
the bottles, this CH is in the gaseous
state partially, not in a matter state,

176
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:52,299
even you look at it that way. We are
doing a lot of work, a lot of Keshe

177
00:26:52,299 --> 00:27:02,169
Foundations are doing work like this. And
we are looking at plastic pipes. A lot of

178
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:09,010
huge farms in farmlands use what is
called 'drip systems',

179
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:14,440
which is a plastic pipe - just drips
water on the roots, on the base of the

180
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:21,810
root of... doesn't matter what it is. And we
have found out we can use the plastic

181
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:32,970
effectively in farming. Very effectively in farming.

182
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:44,880
Is... we cannot get rid of it. They
can bring as much restriction as they like.

183
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:56,490
Packaging without plastic, at a moment, is
zero possibility. And one of the problems

184
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:04,470
they don't push with degradable plastic,
is very simple.

185
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,940
They say one year, two years. You buy
something and you forget it in the back of the

186
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:19,570
shelf. You come to it, it is all gone. The
security and responsibility of degradable

187
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:27,370
plastic a lot of people are
pushing, has implications. Huge

188
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:33,490
implications, because it has happened. They
create fire, they create all sorts of

189
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:39,180
problems. They increase the rat
population. People don't want to hear.

190
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:45,990
A lot of people are pushing for degradable
plastic. You buy a bottle of coca-cola,

191
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:52,270
degradable six months, twelve month,s one
year; and you happen to put it in a place

192
00:28:52,270 --> 00:29:01,330
where there is an electric connection, and it
just starts degrading. A lot of

193
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:08,670
research is not coming to public and
public push for it. There is a problem.

194
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:14,140
Even though a lot of people say we don't
use plastics and everything else; and

195
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:21,580
this week, some nations as of today
actually, have banned certain kind of plastics. You

196
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,450
cannot do.

197
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:32,500
High density and low density bags are
part of our life. We have to have a

198
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:46,740
choice when we dispose of them, not when
they dispose of themselves. These are a lot of

199
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,960
current problems. There are two things
public have to learn - there is a public

200
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:01,000
LDPE service and public CAP service. We cannot....
degradable plastic has been ruled out

201
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,559
nearly five years, even though they said
they are working on it. The hazards, which

202
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:17,340
is creating is beyond imagination.
You can... Somebody's microphone is open.

203
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:24,690
There is a lot of problem with plastics.

204
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:31,780
You put medicine in it. What happened in
two years, three years just opens up,

205
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:45,130
degrades and you have a child passing and
taking it. The, we have to find an

206
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:53,380
alternative to dispose of it in a safe
way, which we have a... It is one of the

207
00:30:53,380 --> 00:31:00,220
things is our priority in the new
factories and research centers. We see

208
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:05,770
how can be done - it's very easy to
degrade it. But then you have another

209
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:13,840
problem, is that you see so much plastic
on the oceans, we have the facilities we

210
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:21,460
have the knowledge to unwind them - we are
not destroying them. You can create a

211
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:28,080
condition that they just open up and
convert to hydrogen and carbon.

212
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:34,990
there'll be a huge depletion of what we
call

213
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:42,760
agriculture, because what we understand, if
the C and H become available in the presence

214
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:49,150
of water they extract nitrogen to
create protein. And there'll be certain

215
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:55,000
places where you create so much protein. And
then they set an amount the planet

216
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:03,580
produces protein through... in conjunction with
nitrogen. This is this has to be

217
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:14,350
controlled very, very drastically - quickly.
And it has to be understood. It has become

218
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:24,570
so entangled, people don't want to
understand this game of cleaning up.

219
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:32,500
Getting rid of plastic has become a
noose around the neck of man. You will have

220
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:39,610
a lot of oil, in the bottom of the ocean,
but you don't have enough protein or the

221
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:45,360
plants to feed. This  a lot of
things. Now the new science, the new

222
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:52,540
technologies, new data. There is
a hypocrisy, we say Amazon produces

223
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:59,950
1/3 of the Earth, or 1/5 of the Earth
oxygen. But what calculation has been

224
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:06,520
done, part of Amazon extracts
oxygen from the atmosphere, because it

225
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:14,320
has so much animals, that it just
produces enough to hold on its own

226
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:27,820
animals. They breathe it all in. The
data, scientific data nowadays is so

227
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:36,250
precise with satellites, that we see it.
Amazon, despite you know what they said

228
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:43,690
oil is from the fossil and from dinosaurs,
and we all accepted. Now, in the past 12

229
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:48,420
months, 18 months what we se in the pattern
of Amazons -

230
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:57,700
these are all huge forests areas we see -
they produce enough to sustain lives,

231
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:04,480
which are in it.
Amazon sometimes runs short. There are so much

232
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,810
animals living in it and breeding, that
they are consuming it. In a way, these trees

233
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:19,929
are developing more for the animals
inside them to be able to live. Is huge.

234
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:28,290
Now we understand totality. Now we
have extracted so much CH bond as

235
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:35,679
different form of plastics, that if we
get rid of them, most of us most probably

236
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,720
come up with diseases we have never known;
most of the plants will die around the

237
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:49,270
world. Because the release of so
much carbon and hydrogen in the seas,

238
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:55,929
where there's oxygen available and we have a
salt - leads to creation of protein. You

239
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:59,710
have plenty of fishes in the sea, or you
have plenty of oil at the bottom of

240
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:06,310
it. But we know there is a ratio that
Earth, in interaction with the Sun,

241
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:13,810
creates protein, or through existence of
nitrogen. And when we take the nitrogen

242
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:20,500
so concentrated in one place, this is
what is going to happen. I was explaining

243
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:27,000
this very recently in the
communication. You know, when they say when

244
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:36,070
people - the first ships - went to America.
Tens of kilometers before they get to

245
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:46,410
the shore, that couldn't go in. And

246
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:52,810
Christoph Columbus had problem getting to
shores, because there was so much fish - so

247
00:35:52,810 --> 00:36:02,459
thick with fish. We're going to see that, most
probably, but in a different form.

248
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:12,369
There's... this dysplastic is not just
cleaning up. What are we gonna do? How

249
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:22,119
much are the damages we are going to
accept with it? We can't give fish to the

250
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:31,119
plants to eat. They need the nitrogen
protein level for themselves. Or we

251
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:37,329
deplete certain strength nitrogen that the
body of the man needs. What diseases will

252
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:46,469
come of it? It is so complicated. We
looked at this, we are looking at this

253
00:36:46,469 --> 00:37:01,859
continuously. Corals we can change. We
can change very, very quickly.

254
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:10,899
We need just conditions that finally
changes the coral area into converting

255
00:37:10,899 --> 00:37:18,689
the CO2, which in
conjunction with the water becomes the acid.

256
00:37:18,689 --> 00:37:37,209
You can convert it very, very easily. As
part of the research now, we are opening

257
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:41,709
research centres in China and the
environment is one of the water and

258
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:49,149
decontamination of corals. We understand very,
very clearly. It will take us two or three

259
00:37:49,149 --> 00:38:13,280
hundred years controlling to convert the
plastic.

260
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,320
They say if you further develop the way
they crush the plastic and they add it to the

261
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:33,750
tarmac. But how much streets left or roads
we can use them in? We have created a

262
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:45,720
mess. (CK) That, yes. But that's what my
question was. If we start,t like the way

263
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:57,060
we started the production of the CO2 kits. If we
can break down plastic as soon as they're

264
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:02,070
finished using it, and knowing the
conversion of it, then at least we have a

265
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:19,640
starting point. Not to top up what is our such a huge problem.
Do you understand. (MK) Yes I understand. But at the moment there is

266
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:29,580
a technology developed - we are aware of it\,Nwe've seen its operation - that converts

267
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:39,300
most of the plastic to energy, electric
energy. The recovery of the plastic from

268
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:46,680
rubbish and conversion, is nearly 90%,
95%. It is developed by the Chinese,

269
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:58,080
Chinese government. We looked at this
machine. And it is a conversion of all

270
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:14,730
the plastics to electric energy. That is the
closest, safest way we can do it. With no

271
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:25,390
emission, zero emission. I've seen the machine. I've been around it.

272
00:40:25,390 --> 00:46:24,610
PART ABOUT ZERO EMISSION ENGINES COMPANIES ARE NOT INTERESTED IN....

273
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:33,950
and it's not gonna clean up anything,
it's gonna make it worse, but we got to

274
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:42,170
see. This plastic situation, if we...
We are not the only one. There is a lot of

275
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:49,360
technologies for it. You can use it, but
it's horrendous what's going to do to us.

276
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:57,620
It's a cat which is out of the bag, out of the womb of the Earth, and we

277
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:15,800
cannot get it back in, and we are still producing
more, and more of it. (CK) Mr. Keshe, with you referring

278
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,590
to the cat out of the bag, of the womb
of the Earth. You said in one of the

279
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:33,440
teachings, that it does matter if they
have depleted the layer of oil. You

280
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:39,440
said that the magnetical field strength is
still there in place. Is there any

281
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:47,240
possibility, with your knowledge, to
replenish that layer of what has been

282
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:57,590
distracted with the same? (MK) It gets done over time. You just have to find the next one,

283
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:07,280
while this is getting filled up. We were
discussing with senior people in the

284
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:13,340
government, very recently. They said, 'We
would like to clean up the under water.

285
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:18,500
There is a huge contamination of the
under water.'. I said, 'yes, but which part of

286
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,610
the technology do you want me to give
you?'.

287
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:27,900
But there is a problem. As long as you
don't clean up the surface, which feeds

288
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:33,420
the bottom, there is no use trying to get rid
of the poison in the bottom, because it

289
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:39,720
keeps on washing in. We got to change the
atmosphere, environment on the top, give

290
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:47,190
it 3 -10 years for it to wash
into the deep reservoirs. And then yes,

291
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:54,720
it's cleaned up. Primarily we can
apply a technology to do, but we don't

292
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:07,320
clean up the source. It's one of the
problems. We cannot take one piece

293
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:13,350
anymore and say we solve this one. We
have to look at it from the structure

294
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:26,340
A to Z. Then we can solve the problem.
There is a huge... the Earth will pull

295
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:30,510
in, it will create enough oil. Just
give it time.

296
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:38,250
Maybe... I reckon it takes about 18-20 years
to fill up the oil reserves, and they'll

297
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:46,920
never finish. So if you tap into it,
the more you pull, the more it gets

298
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:57,210
pulled, but in his time to convert. I was
with the oil men, from a Saudi oil,

299
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:03,030
and I was telling him, 'why are you building such a
huge refineries?'. 'Oh', he said. 'It creates so

300
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:06,720
much jobs.' I said, 'come with my
technology, I produce what you like, you do not

301
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:18,180
need the refining.

302
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:28,420
We got to teach slowly, but the
government's are not there to learn slowly.

303
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:39,130
We have huge transition time and the next
cycle, next maybe 200 years, our children

304
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:42,819
still clean up the mess we have
created. It's just like, we had a party

305
00:50:42,819 --> 00:50:48,460
and leave all the dirty dishes and the thing
for mom to come and clean up. Or

306
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:56,710
someone's going to clean up. This generation
of us, those of us who were born in the fifties and

307
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:04,029
sixtie, have had such a big party, we'll
take our great-grandchildren maybe to

308
00:51:04,029 --> 00:51:17,079
clean up the party we had. If you look at...
We are going into recycling, recycle

309
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:26,529
everything. But, if you know how much
glass we have produced. All these huge

310
00:51:26,529 --> 00:51:32,890
buildings, all these sheets of glass, all
these glasses we have produced - something

311
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:43,440
like about 20% of it is getting recycled.

312
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:56,799
Nobody has looked at this glass
situation. All the steals, all the metals

313
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:09,339
we have produced, we used. Our
generation trying to develop our lives

314
00:52:09,339 --> 00:52:20,819
to be modernized, have created a mess, that it will take
centuries to clean up. Centuries, if we ever

315
00:52:20,819 --> 00:52:32,020
be able to clean up.

316
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:43,820
The fish, 300.000 pounds,
small fishing boats. That is 150.000 kilos

317
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:52,190
of fish in one trip - 3 to 5 days trip. And how long do you

318
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:58,640
think these seas are gonna answer, are gonna be there. And then it is sold at ten cents a

319
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:16,739
pound, 20 cents a kilo.

320
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:22,450
This planet soon is gonna cry. I don't have
enough to give - it's like a mother, which

321
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:28,569
goes you know, the brest goes dry and
cannot breast-feed the child anymore. We are

322
00:53:28,569 --> 00:53:45,970
getting to it. We are pushing it to see
when he it is going to dry up. We are taking

323
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:53,549
every strands over strain out of it.

324
00:53:53,549 --> 00:54:00,339
You understand, there is something very logical
behind the whole system. How much protein

325
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:07,019
can this farmer produce to sustain life? He can
sustain maybe 300-400

326
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:13,359
thousands of times, more than what he has now.
But then it comes different elements of

327
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:25,569
that, so we have to mutate.

328
00:54:25,569 --> 00:54:31,239
This is part of the space technology we
are looking at with what we provide to

329
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:39,069
man,
how would he mutate in the space. He has

330
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:44,319
to mutate. We cannot create the
atmospheric condition of this planet all the

331
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:48,729
time. We can create fields to be
straight enough to what ????
