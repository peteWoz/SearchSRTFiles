1
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:14,699
with his soul. In so many ways, we got to

2
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:17,999
go back to the basic and make some small

3
00:50:17,999 --> 00:50:25,890
corrections, or add to the knowledge to

4
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:31,229
be able to go to the next step. If we

5
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:41,449
look and understand how, in which steps,

6
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:45,630
mankind has taken a step and has gone

7
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:50,839
through the process of creation a lot of

8
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,400
mysteries about: the life of the man,

9
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,410
operation of the life of the man, the

10
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:57,239
soul of the man, operation of the soul of

11
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:00,180
the man, operation of physicality of the

12
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:07,019
man - all can be understood. All can be

13
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:10,319
taken to the next step. All can be added,

14
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:19,500
or can be understood to be added.

15
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,800
What does this mean? One of the

16
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,180
fundamental problems, in the whole cycle

17
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,770
of the understanding of the physiology

18
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:33,000
of man, is the construction of the

19
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,560
physicality of the man, and how

20
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,900
everything has been based on one, or two

21
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,680
elements, but man has calculated

22
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,840
everything else but these one or two

23
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:58,859
elements. This is very much, this is very

24
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:03,810
much like we have missed half of the

25
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:08,010
equation. We have missed half of the

26
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:12,980
knowledge. We have missed part of it,

27
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:17,119
which was really there and we didn't see.

28
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:24,210
Or, we never understood, that this is part

29
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,670
of totality, this is part of we have been

30
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:31,560
missing. This is in essence part, which

31
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:36,720
will bring us, forces us, we have no

32
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:43,140
choice but to understand it. To be able

33
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:50,790
to continue with it. To be able to

34
00:52:50,790 --> 00:53:00,800
extract from it the real knowledge.

35
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:10,610
And in so many ways, this Carbon-14, as

36
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:16,410
an energy of the plasma, as energy of

37
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:20,640
the fields of the plasma, has never been

38
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,690
understood, in clarity. And man has made,

39
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:28,740
because of his presence, a lot of

40
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,020
mistakes in this structure of the

41
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:39,530
amino acid of the body of the man.

42
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:45,900
It causes cancers and it cures cancers .It

43
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,920
creates the destruction of the

44
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,290
connection layers of the brain of the

45
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:56,430
man. Leads to your age, your stroke. Leads

46
00:53:56,430 --> 00:54:13,110
to understanding of the total work.

47
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:17,880
It affects every operation of the

48
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,610
physicality of the man. It affects every

49
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:24,250
operation of the soul of the man. It

50
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:27,040
affects every connection between the

51
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,510
soul of the man and the soul of

52
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:37,630
physicality. And most of the time the

53
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:42,150
world of science has never considered,

54
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:51,820
never understood, that... what this means. What

55
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,430
can be created, what can be given, what

56
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:57,930
can be added, what can be amalgamated

57
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,310
from understanding of the work of the

58
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:15,210
Carbon-14.

59
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:18,250
One of the problems of it, is that the

60
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,170
scientific world has not managed to

61
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:24,550
produce it - the way it works in the body

62
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:26,710
of the man, in the what we call as a

63
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:28,780
GaNS condition, as a plasmatic

64
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:41,590
condition. It has a sequence, it repeats

65
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:47,650
itself in different combinations, and because

66
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:55,680
of its dynamism, and it's what you call

67
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,240
separation of the physicality from the

68
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:12,240
neuro system, man have always ignored it.

69
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:18,540
If you look in the dimension of the work

70
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:27,080
of nitrogen, we look to the work of

71
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:33,780
Carbon-14, and we look into operation of,

72
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:38,310
like CH3, it has and should have given us

73
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:44,339
a lot of clues. We should have understood

74
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:50,880
a lot clues. I spent a lot of time today in

75
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,950
trying to explain the work of Carbon-14,

76
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:59,040
because it's something... it is so fundamental

77
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,460
that it needs a time to be spent on it,

78
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:05,280
because now you will understand the work

79
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,140
of the transmutation. How transmutation

80
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,230
becomes possible? It comes the work of

81
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,609
transportation across the universe. It

82
00:57:17,609 --> 00:57:20,910
comes from the point of insulation and

83
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:23,599
isolation of the fields of the universe.

84
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:28,430
[Somebody's microphone is open.] It comes

85
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:32,430
to understanding the totality and the

86
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:36,800
relationship, between different part and

87
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,970
structure of the physicality, and the

88
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:42,240
soul of the man. And in so many ways, is

89
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,510
the pathway of the soul of the man, to

90
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:47,940
connect with the Universal Community, in

91
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:51,890
the path of the line of communication.

92
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:57,900
When we spoke about the carbon in CO2. When

93
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,470
we use it for conductivity and

94
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:04,349
connection in our medical applications,

95
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:09,589
or in other fields. Carbon-14 is the same

96
00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:14,640
but in the dimension with a connection

97
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,660
with the soul of man, and physicality of

98
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:25,970
the man. Is the pathway, the way, the... as

99
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:29,180
call it, the wire, the string, where the

100
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,160
soul of the man leaves the physicality

101
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:37,090
of the man. Is the connection, where you

102
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:40,580
go - what you call a dream time - but it

103
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,280
knows where to connect to - happens

104
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:49,960
through that. It has a fingerprint of the

105
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,000
interaction of the soul. It has a

106
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,890
fingerprint of the interaction and action

107
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:59,750
of the universe. And in so many different

108
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:03,530
ways, we have to understand the work of

109
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:08,650
Carbon-14, carbon at all - all together.

110
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:14,900
What is a Carbon-14?! Rick can you pull up

111
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:20,570
on the Wikipedia, or a wiki, what is

112
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:25,070
Carbon-14 in a matter state? Can you get

113
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:28,770
it?

114
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:34,380
(RC) Yeah, yes sure, just a minute Mr.Keshe. (MK) What is

115
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:37,950
interesting, you got to understand, we

116
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:42,000
look at Carbon-14 in a plasmatic state,

117
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,420
not in a matter state. But in so many

118
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:55,970
ways, if we look at a Carbon-14, in

119
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:58,970
partially in the world of the science,

120
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:06,720
the present science, they call it graphene. It

121
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,609
behaves that way, in some occasions.

122
01:00:10,609 --> 01:00:15,480
Because it looks as to be the end, and at

123
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,730
the same time, is the beginning of every

124
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:23,790
nerve. One end of the neural system, where

125
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:27,240
your nerves stop, is the orientation

126
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,150
of the Carbon-14, which creates the

127
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:33,930
feedback. It's Carbon-14, which gives you

128
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,240
the isolation at the point of amputation,

129
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,580
and the release of energy, as what we

130
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:45,900
call it - phantom pain. And it's part of

131
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,690
the whole structure of our existence in

132
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:52,050
real life. Would you like to read it for

133
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,869
us?

134
01:00:53,869 --> 01:01:16,010
(RC) Ammm, sure. Okay, yyymmm, my microphone.... jest a second. (MK) Has the fire alarm gone off?

135
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:19,710
and you are back. Okay, I read it.

136
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:24,170
It says: "Carbon-14, radiocarbon is a

137
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,760
radioactive isotope of a carbon, with an

138
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,950
atomic nucleus containing six protons

139
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:32,420
and eight neutrons. Its presence in

140
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:35,220
organic materials in organic material is

141
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:38,630
the basis of the radiocarbon dating

142
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:41,840
method

143
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:47,570
pioneered by William Libby and colleagues

144
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:54,710
to date archaeological, geological and

145
01:01:54,710 --> 01:02:00,420
hydrogeological.... something." Somebody is on

146
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,780
my screen, or is somebody... is it you

147
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,359
playing with the background? (RC) I was going

148
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:09,900
to make it larger if you want to leave it there, or

149
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,840
I could read it if you like. (MK) No, no it's okay,

150
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,119
carry on reading it, because we have to

151
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,940
understand this.

152
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:20,490
Carry on. (RC) You want me to read then,

153
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,410
is that what you are saying? (MK) Yeah, yeah. I read it. I read it

154
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:28,310
up to the first bracket, 1949, yep. (RC) Yep, so okay. So

155
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:31,790
"Carbon-14 was discovered on February

156
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:36,720
27th, 1940, by Martin Kamen and Sam Ruben

157
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,730
at the University of California

158
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:41,520
Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley,

159
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,890
California. Its existence had been

160
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:49,320
suggested by Franz Kurie in 1934. it

161
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,720
goes on to say, "There are three naturally

162
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:55,850
occurring isotopes of carbon on Earth:

163
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:59,640
carbon-12, which makes up 99% of all

164
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:03,420
carbon on Earth; carbon-1, which makes up

165
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:08,070
1%, and carbon-14, which occurs in trace

166
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:11,640
amounts, making up about 1 or 1.5

167
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:16,440
atoms per 10 to the twelfth atoms

168
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,369
of carbon in the atmosphere. Carbon-12

169
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:22,950
and carbon-13 are both stable, while

170
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:25,170
carbon-14 is unstable and has a

171
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:31,020
half-life of 5730 years plus or minus 40

172
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:36,140
years. Carbon-14 decays into nitrogen-14

173
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:41,310
through beta decay. A gram of carbon

174
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:46,109
containing one atom of carbon-14 per 10

175
01:03:46,109 --> 01:03:51,030
to the twelfth atoms will emit about 0.2

176
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:55,140
beta particles per second. The primary

177
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:55,559
natural

178
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:58,829
source of carbon-14 on Earth is cosmic

179
01:03:58,829 --> 01:04:02,189
ray action on nitrogen in the atmosphere,

180
01:04:02,189 --> 01:04:08,119
and is therefore a cosmogenic nuclide.

181
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:11,599
However open-air nuclear testing between

182
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:17,089
1955-1980 contributed to this pool.

183
01:04:17,089 --> 01:04:20,279
The different isotopes of carbon do not

184
01:04:20,279 --> 01:04:22,799
differ appreciably in their chemical

185
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,799
properties. This resemblance is used in

186
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:28,199
chemical and biological research, in the

187
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:31,219
technique called carbon labeling:

188
01:04:31,219 --> 01:04:34,019
carbon-14 atoms can be used to replace

189
01:04:34,019 --> 01:04:37,289
nonradioactive carbon, in order to trace

190
01:04:37,289 --> 01:04:39,569
chemical and biochemical reactions

191
01:04:39,569 --> 01:04:43,019
involving carbon atoms from any given

192
01:04:43,019 --> 01:04:48,900
organic compound." Do you want me to continue? (MK) Can you repeat that last

193
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:55,259
sentence? (RC) Okay. I'll say the whole paragraph,

194
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:56,999
it might make more sense. (MK) Ok.

195
01:04:56,999 --> 01:04:59,670
(RC) "The different isotopes of carbon do not

196
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:02,609
differ appreciably in their chemical

197
01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:06,299
properties. This resemblance is used in

198
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:08,939

carbon-14 atoms can be used to replace

201

organic compound. (MK) And, if you go back to

205
01:05:31,349 --> 01:05:41,390
the first line, of the top paragraph. (RC) Ups, just a minute.

206
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:51,280
(MK) Just go up.

207
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,350
It says, "carbon-14 is a radioactive

208
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:59,960
isotope of carbon", and then it says at

209
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:07,160
the bottom: "Carbon-14 can be used to

210
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:11,480
replace nonradioactive carbon, in order

211
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:14,920
to trace chemical and biological reactions

212
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,480
involving carbon atom for any organic

213
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:26,150
compound." And when you read it, it says it

214
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:30,890
decays to nitrogen, but all this is in a

215
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:36,890
matter state. In the condition of the

216
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:39,770
plasma body of the man, and in the

217
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:44,230
dimension of the universe,

218
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:47,180
what does radioactive means? Means

219
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:55,720
energetic; and the energetic dimension of

220
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,760
this Carbon-14 is absolutely amazing,

221
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:10,550
because it's not being a beta decay, it's

222
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:16,750
being a dynamic, plasmatic fields, which is

223
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:20,540
continuously, travels beyond the speed of

224
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:25,730
light, on the matter state. The reason for

225
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:27,770
it, which has never (been) understood. Or now

226
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:33,590
maybe it can be explained? Is... neutrons are

227
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:36,830
the source of the energy, because they

228
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:42,530
want to decay to create stability. They

229
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:45,790
split into a proton and an electron

230
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:51,600
to create

231
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,930
stable condition for themselves. But, in

232
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:59,050
the case of the Carbon-14, you have two

233
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:02,950
neutrons, at the same time busy releasing,

234
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:06,430
and in that process to do dynamic point

235
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:08,920
centers, trying to balance, or create a

236
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,310
balance in their field interaction,

237
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:16,960
creates a line of insulation. A line of

238
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,200
magnetic field, which does not accept

239
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,069
anymore

240
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:23,170
because at the moment it has circled

241
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:25,779
itself. In the term of magnetic

242
01:08:25,779 --> 01:08:29,740
insulation and isolation - when you have

243
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:32,229
the double neutron-base, like this. It

244
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:35,410
means that the matter state of it is

245
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:36,910
within itself.

246
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:39,759
It isolates itself. hIt has a huge amount

247
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:44,290
of energy to release. And that gives a

248
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:48,490
very high dynamic center to its carbon

249
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:51,790
structure - the other 6 protons and

250
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:57,479
neutrons, and it literally, it catapults

251
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:06,790
this material. A normal carbon does not

252
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:14,140
behave like this. A radioactive material,

253
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:17,310
which means has a huge amount of energy,

254
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:23,500
in a plasmatic condition has a huge, huge

255
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:30,399
amount of energy, which in balance with

256
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,490
having no electron to feed off, to

257
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:38,529
split into, that it can create a balance

258
01:09:38,529 --> 01:09:42,960
of itself to become an atom. It creates,

259
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,810
what I call, super bullet out of carbon-14,

260
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:50,680
and that allows the man to travel the

261
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,760
depth of a space, as a few. If you can

262
01:09:54,760 --> 01:10:00,130
replicate it. It teaches a lot to those of

263
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:03,670
us, who wants to understand. Because of

264
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:03,940
this

265
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:08,969
higher-speed, it creates a line of

266
01:10:08,969 --> 01:10:11,080
transportation for the field matter

267
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:17,370
states of it. Carbon-14 is a plasmatic-

268
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:21,010
radioactive, not matter-state radioactive,

269
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:23,560
if we can call it that way. It's a source of

270
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:27,460
energy, which is so much, is like a virus

271
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:34,800
sit around the nucleus of the carbon. And

272
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,780
because of that amount of energy it gives

273
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:40,570
to it, it just makes a fire ball out of

274
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:45,550
the others. It is a free engine, it is a free

275
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:50,730
energy resource for the structure. And

276
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:54,610
when you enter in the dimension of

277
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:58,989
the matter state, a lot of doctors, a

278
01:10:58,989 --> 01:11:02,410
lot of doctors make a mistake between it

279
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:08,590
and nitrogen. It's the cause of many

280
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:15,790
cancers, but it can be understood due to

281
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:19,449
its weight. Compared to the other carbon,

282
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:22,719
it leads to the combination of matter

283
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:30,489
state interactions. It's a massive ball

284
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:35,670
of fire, and this fire does not stop.

285
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:39,670
Because energy released by one Neutron

286
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:43,300
to go through, what we call splitting, what

287
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,140
to become nuclear decay is; automatically

288
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:51,340
absorbed by the other Neutron, and in

289
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:54,730
that process, in the dynamic magnetic

290
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:58,989
fields, part of the energy given to

291
01:11:58,989 --> 01:12:01,210
other protons and neutrons - they become

292
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:06,340
active too. And in so many ways, if you

293
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:09,940
understand aging by, what we call, carbon-14

294
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:12,790
dating, should give you very clear

295
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:16,250
understanding - is the time when you stop

296
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:22,070
the whole process. Then you can trace it,

297
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:24,860
when and how it was stopped by itself, or

298
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:27,650
in the process it went through, a condition has

299
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,270
to stop, because of lack of transfer of

300
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:38,930
energy. Interesting enough, if we go to

301
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:45,680
the next step and understand that you

302
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:51,670
have a carbon and you have a, in a way

303
01:12:51,670 --> 01:13:01,520
a Tritium. Two cells working together.

304
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:08,840
Two cells working, in a way, as a helium, or

305
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:13,130
in a way, as a Tritium, and sometimes due

306
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:18,160
to their energy balance, they behave as

307
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:26,950
just two neutrons.

308
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:33,020
What is, this will give, is the extension

309
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:41,000
in how to understand we age. How fast we

310
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,860
age and why will we use the GaNS plasma

311
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:48,860
technology on the cell of the man,

312
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:56,930
we see huge changes. Because we interfere

313
01:13:56,930 --> 01:14:02,180
with line of field transfer energy. This

314
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:07,960
is why our CH3 GaNS shows a lot of

315
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:17,900
characteristics of Carbon-14. And if we

316
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:29,300
understand it we can fully utilize it.

317
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:41,400
[Air blowing]

318
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:45,640
When we take measurements on the decay

319
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:51,850
of whatever, we always make a mistake in

320
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:54,480
conversion of the energy of Carbon-14

321
01:14:54,480 --> 01:15:04,000
with nitrogen. It's so common that because

322
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,450
of it we have missed many, many parts of

323
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:09,610
to whole structure of the understanding

324
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:32,660
of the work of the body of the man.

325
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:35,460
What I would like to do, I would like to

326
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:39,030
take you to a step to understand this

327
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,870
process.

328
01:15:39,870 --> 01:16:05,130
I need a whiteboard. Rick would you like

329
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:07,710
to write in my place, because I cannot,

330
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:12,270
I lost my screen again. (RC) Ok, well we

331
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:14,250
do see your whiteboard right now but....

332
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:17,340
(MK) Yeah, but I don't have my screen pad. It's

333
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,370
okay, I write, no problem. When you have a

334
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:27,540
hydrogen, if your look, it's not an atom in

335
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:30,030
a way, it's a half atom, because it

336
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:33,630
doesn't carry any neutrons. It's the lack

337
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:41,150
of neutrons in it. The next step here is

338
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:52,510
nitrogen, or if we can put it, Carbon-14.

339
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:56,320
Very strange things, how I cannot use my

340
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:02,639
system. Then you understand the process

341
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:07,749
0 to 14. Now the next 14 comes here.

342
01:17:07,749 --> 01:17:13,989
Again Carbon-14 but it shows itself as

343
01:17:13,989 --> 01:17:43,570
silica. In that process of....

344
01:17:43,570 --> 01:18:01,880
I've got a problem in writing this down. The next

345
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:17,150
14, Carbon-14 is silica. You understand, you

346
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:22,070
see it there, another 14. One of the main

347
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:27,860
components life of the man. When you take

348
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:40,230
this to another step - 28,

349
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:48,030
14;

350
01:18:48,030 --> 01:19:06,970
and another 14, is dynamic, 42.

351
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:19,720
Can somebody tell us what's this 14?

352
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:24,370
In transition of the strength of the

353
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:35,530
magnetic field, is Mr COHN. Now I

354
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:37,540
appreciate what a beautiful thing I had,

355
01:19:37,540 --> 01:20:01,340
as a pen. If you look at this, again...

356
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:07,180
What does it take us to? Where does it

357
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:21,550
take this to?

358
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:27,439
You come to something very easy. (AG) 56. (MK) Yes, I

359
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:29,780
know, I just don't have my screen. Hi Armen,

360
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:34,699
how are you darling? (AG) Good.

361
01:20:34,699 --> 01:20:43,369
(MK) That's good. Now you see, how Carbon-14

362
01:20:43,369 --> 01:20:46,939
has been the backbone, and different

363
01:20:46,939 --> 01:20:56,719
combination of it - here is 56, the next

364
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:05,329
one is 70. And then look what 70 does,

365
01:21:05,329 --> 01:21:08,510
which element sits with you at 70. But

366
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:11,719
you have to remember something very

367
01:21:11,719 --> 01:21:17,059
strange. Here, we don't see usually as

368
01:21:17,059 --> 01:21:22,669
such, what takes place has another

369
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:35,670
element we know, with number 42.

370
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:40,770
Then you understand how much our

371
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:43,690
scientists of the past have forgotten

372
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:47,140
and have not seen. Because they never

373
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:52,030
considered a dynamic structure that none

374
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:53,890
of it, one of it,

375
01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:59,160
two of it, three of it,

376
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:04,720
four of it has created the cycle of life

377
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:18,989
on this planet for mankind.

378
01:22:18,989 --> 01:22:27,610
And look at the half balance lines, and

379
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:33,280
then you see how life of the man has

380
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:39,989
gradually taken shape on this planet.

381
01:22:39,989 --> 01:22:44,170
This raises a fantastic question, and

382
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:51,460
that is very, very simply; very, very

383
01:22:51,460 --> 01:23:01,389
simple: Would the body of the man, would

384
01:23:01,389 --> 01:23:05,289
the body of the man working on a Carbon-14,

385
01:23:05,289 --> 01:23:10,329
will suit to travel the depth of the

386
01:23:10,329 --> 01:23:14,050
Universe on the lines of the Carbon-14

387
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:20,250
magnetic field of the Universe? It is

388
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:35,590
absolutely a perfect match.

389
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:43,450
And if you look at this zone, you look at

390
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:48,880
this zone, and then you look at every

391
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:55,090
other zone with Carbon-12, then you

392
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:58,000
understand how the soul of the man and

393
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,760
the physicality of the man, physicality

394
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,730
of the man, the soul of the man

395
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:06,270
continuously repeat themselves. And

396
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:14,560
that's how we dream. And this is how the

397
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,380
two are so close to each other, that we

398
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:25,060
have lost sight of our soul, line of

399
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:29,320
communication of our soul. Where through

400
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:33,220
the physicality we communicate energy

401
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:38,050
transfer to come on top, but the work of

402
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:39,820
the Universe through transfer of the

403
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:49,099
soul is Carbon-14.

404
01:24:49,099 --> 01:24:55,669
And we live through carbon-12, our soul

405
01:24:55,669 --> 01:24:57,709
lives in the line of communication of

406
01:24:57,709 --> 01:25:04,489
carbon-14, and this is how we will travel

407
01:25:04,489 --> 01:25:12,679
the space of the universe. Then you

408
01:25:12,679 --> 01:25:16,070
understand how easy should be for

409
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:19,039
mankind to become travelers of the

410
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:29,570
Universe. Every indication on the

411
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:31,789
transfer of gravitational-magnetic field

412
01:25:31,789 --> 01:25:33,199
of the space of the speed of the

413
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,329
universe, sits within the structure of the

414
01:25:35,329 --> 01:25:37,969
amino acid and physicality of the man, in

415
01:25:37,969 --> 01:25:41,809
a dimension of magnetic fields. You're a

416
01:25:41,809 --> 01:25:50,740
perfect match.

417
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:57,230
Now, does the man understand that much, that

418
01:25:57,230 --> 01:26:02,990
in checking the physical dimensions in

419
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:07,310
matter state, sees silica, nitrogen, amino

420
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:11,410
acid and iron; or is it in reality

421
01:26:11,410 --> 01:26:37,210
multiple combination of carbon-14?

422
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:41,540
Then it comes to us, a new dimension

423
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:45,380
in the line of communication for control

424
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:51,889
of the space reactors. Understanding the

425
01:26:51,889 --> 01:26:54,920
creation of the soul and dimension of the

426
01:26:54,920 --> 01:27:03,679
emotion of the man in the line of

427
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:11,409
physicality, and the soul of the man.

428
01:27:11,409 --> 01:27:21,340
To understand how to travel, how to

429
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:28,840
nourish, how to multiply in the depth of

430
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:43,989
the Universe or anywhere in the Universe.

431
01:27:43,989 --> 01:27:46,360
I warned the knowledge seekers yesterday in

432
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,780
the teaching, in the private teaching -

433
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:59,769
what was coming. Those of you, who work

434
01:27:59,769 --> 01:28:02,699
on the dimension of any transfer,

435
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:09,599
transportation in the dimension of a

436
01:28:09,599 --> 01:28:12,849
structural conductivity of the

437
01:28:12,849 --> 01:28:15,130
physicality of the man, or the soul of

438
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:34,380
the man. Now you have found a very big answer.

439
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:42,360
if you look, when you look at the Alex

440
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:53,780
beatz Magrav systems. You use CO2 for

441
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:56,310
communication line for diabetic and

442
01:28:56,310 --> 01:29:03,449
everything else. Now, you can add the

443
01:29:03,449 --> 01:29:05,550
dimension of the transportation of the

444
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:18,960
soul to it. Now man has two choices: Do I

445
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,020
want to travel in the dimension of the

446
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:25,710
slow of a carbon? Or, do I want to travel in

447
01:29:25,710 --> 01:29:52,319
the dimension of super-speed of the soul?

448
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:57,739
Can I use the plasmatic-magnetic field

449
01:29:57,739 --> 01:30:06,389
of CH3, which I can produce so easy, to

450
01:30:06,389 --> 01:30:28,140
become the giver of energy, as carbon-14?

451
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:33,790
Is there a shortcut to it, or does actually

452
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:40,690
sugar behave like carbon-14 in super conductivity

453
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:53,500
of the energy of one hydrogen atom? Is this is why the

454
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:56,110
body of the man evolves so fast on this

455
01:30:56,110 --> 01:31:02,500
planet? Because of the presence of the basic

456
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:05,800
sugar, which gives you a carbon-14? Which

457
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:10,330
itself, already very active, has an

458
01:31:10,330 --> 01:31:13,480
additional way to release the energy of,

459
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:19,270
to become energy source of energy. Or is

460
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:22,810
the additional electron, or additional

461
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:25,920
neutron, or additional proton -

462
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:30,100
depends how you define it - becomes a

463
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:36,340
point that, due to interaction of the

464
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:42,300
two neutrons in carbon-14, in a physical

465
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:49,510
collision with the additional proton, lead

466
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:53,290
to release of energy, that man

467
01:31:53,290 --> 01:32:02,830
needs to create and dynamism in the amino

468
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:09,810
acid?

469
01:32:09,810 --> 01:32:13,610
And become the source of energy. In a way,

470
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:17,520
we introduce a barrier. When the bullet

471
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,180
comes,

472
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:21,060
let's absorb the energy off - and that

473
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:23,070
energy, with that bullet, the bullet

474
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:27,380
release continuously, is by the double

475
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:30,390
protons or neutrons, as you have an

476
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:32,070
energy confirmation in the plasma

477
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:36,060
condition, which with the interaction of

478
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:41,330
the lighter one - two to one - that is two

479
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:44,280
protons confirming with the electron as

480
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:49,410
a neutron. In the CH3 with a third one, is

481
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:52,950
like putting a barrier or creating in a

482
01:32:52,950 --> 01:33:00,300
plasmatic field force, very much like you

483
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:06,500
create a motion. This is your two

484
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,620
hydrogens

485
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:11,520
and this is your single hydrogen. And in

486
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:16,340
process, where you already have a

487
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:20,640
carbon here - you create a release of

488
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:24,000
energy to the amino acid which, is bounded

489
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:30,780
to it. And this amino acid becomes active,

490
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:34,560
it receives energy, itu can survive. So, if

491
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,800
we can increase the binding of CH3, or a

492
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,170
carbon-14 in the presence of the body of

493
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:43,260
the man, which creates a continuous

494
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:46,200
supply into the amino acid. Which means

495
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:49,200
the amino acid does not need continuously to

496
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:54,060
deplete and then replete it, gives a life

497
01:33:54,060 --> 01:34:00,440
of centuries to man, because there is no damage.

498
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:04,230
There is no continuous depletion

499
01:34:04,230 --> 01:34:10,200
refilling it. This is how you can extend life on

500
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:10,940
this planet.

501
01:34:16,409 --> 01:34:19,059
Simple understanding of the transfer of

502
01:34:19,059 --> 01:34:30,039
the fields of the Universe, can make a lot of difference for the man, if the man understands what's going on.

503
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:46,860
(RC) Excuse me Mr Keshe, could we get you to just move your microphone away from mouth. A tiny bit, not too much. (MK) Is this ok? (RC) Yes, sure.

504
01:34:46,860 --> 01:35:07,400
(MK) So, now you understand how we can even extend the life of the man, through understanding the operation of carbon-14. And how we can use this operation of carbon-14 to

505
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:29,600
create the fast dynamic motion of the protein or the body of the man in the dimension of the soul of the transportation.

506
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:51,360
Now the science of physiology and the science of the soul of the man (...).

507
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:56,950
Now we can understand much more. Now we

508
01:35:56,950 --> 01:36:17,810
can act upon it.

509
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:22,640
We can operate through it, we can extend

510
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:26,870
the life with it, and then we do not

511
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:30,320
depend on a cycle of the rotation of one

512
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:36,230
thing we called the day, the year, or

513
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:39,080
anything else, which mankind has chosen

514
01:36:39,080 --> 01:37:07,430
to call this thing. Now, which side of the

515
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:36,600
story do you want me to sing for you?

516
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:40,690
Have the scientists been right to

517
01:37:40,690 --> 01:37:43,810
measure the decay of life of anything on

518
01:37:43,810 --> 01:38:03,560
a carbon-14, or did they miss the boat?

519
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:10,790
Or, can we use the operation of carbon-14 to

520
01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:13,430
create a new dimension for life of the

521
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:19,250
man in the space? Remember last week, when

522
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:21,170
I spoke about the separation of the gaps

523
01:38:21,170 --> 01:38:24,200
between the galaxies? I spoke about carbon-14.

524
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:28,790
I start putting things out for you to

525
01:38:28,790 --> 01:38:30,380
see what you understand till the next

526
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:32,750
time, till the next teaching. Till the next

527
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:34,880
time, might be next time, or the time after,

528
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:40,760
or time after. But the teaching now

529
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:43,550
starts getting meaning. It starts having

530
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:46,370
understanding, because if you can create

531
01:38:46,370 --> 01:38:48,770
a condition of transfer of the energy in

532
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:51,410
the level of carbon-14 we can tap into

533
01:38:51,410 --> 01:38:53,360
the universal transportation line. You

534
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,550
can tap into the understanding, creating

535
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:57,860
life for the others who are the

536
01:38:57,860 --> 01:39:00,260
passenger of this line, to manifest

537
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:02,900
themselves in the portal of life you

538
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:08,120
create. All you do, you create a new bus

539
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:11,500
stop.

540
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:13,730
Would anybody like to take of here, of the

541
01:39:13,730 --> 01:39:15,530
thing? I have created a condition,

542
01:39:15,530 --> 01:39:28,780
which I can create in that replication.

543
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:31,910
If you want to understand, maybe we can

544
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:35,780
explain, It's the super conductivity within

545
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:37,790
the conductivity of the plasma itself.

546
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:40,310
Now you can imagine what the scientists

547
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:42,470
were telling us. Super conductive

548
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:44,480
materials, not only now you have the

549
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,400
super conductive materials in the form

550
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:50,930
of the nano-layering, now you have super

551
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:56,150
conductive path, to transport that - now that we understand

552
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:58,820
the body of the man is made of

553
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:03,940
GaNSes.

554
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:13,160
Start adding up!

555
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:17,650
But, do you want to invite everyone in? Or,

556
01:40:17,650 --> 01:40:22,780
do you want to have a specific length, or

557
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:26,630
specific people? You don't want to invite

558
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:29,150
the cousins but you would like the uncles

559
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:37,880
to come. And you don't know if the uncle

560
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:43,010
will be dressed in the suit, or they'll come

561
01:40:43,010 --> 01:40:44,890
in pajamas.

562
01:40:44,890 --> 01:40:48,830
How do you manifest that, only the uncle

563
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:51,080
turns up and no cousins, only the cousins

564
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:53,860
come, you don't want the uncles?

565
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:56,720
Go back to your teaching. Go back to

566
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:59,150
understanding . G back to understanding

567
01:40:59,150 --> 01:41:02,240
of the interaction of the fields of the

568
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:10,070
gravitational field with inertia, which

569
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:12,170
leads to creation of manifestation of

570
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:16,820
the material or matter state - then you

571
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:18,909
understand.

572
01:41:18,909 --> 01:41:22,989
Then you understand you can create the

573
01:41:22,989 --> 01:41:25,210
condition of the confirmation of

574
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:28,230
existence by introduction of the third

575
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:32,050
strength in the carbon-14, and any

576
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:34,780
passenger of Universe, which matches into

577
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:40,179
that, will manifest in your portal.

578
01:41:40,179 --> 01:41:42,610
It's very much, when you create a matter

579
01:41:42,610 --> 01:41:44,920
state with the interaction of the fields of

580
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:48,400
your cores, it's you who by introduction

581
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,639
of the inertia, dictates what matter from

582
01:41:51,639 --> 01:41:54,010
the energy of the atmosphere will

583
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:58,060
manifest itself. In the case of liquid

584
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:02,860
and iron we manifested, we produced blood -

585
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:06,820
horrible. In a case of interaction of the

586
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:09,540
fields, we created gold, zinc, magnesium

587
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:12,580
and the other one, which we've see the test results

588
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:15,610
as was done. Independently to confirm

589
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:19,840
what is in collected. Now understanding

590
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:22,719
the transfer and transportation and a

591
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,880
connection between the soul of the man,

592
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,190
which now becomes the language of the

593
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:30,550
Universal Community in understanding of

594
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:35,199
this transportation line. Now, you can

595
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:38,860
invite friends home, and then you dictate

596
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:42,310
what friends and whose friends. I don't

597
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:44,530
want this. I want to see what it gives me,

598
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:46,960
at such and such a strength in the

599
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:53,409
spectrum of the magnesium, with the carbon-14,

600
01:42:53,409 --> 01:42:56,020
and see which creatures of God come up,

601
01:42:56,020 --> 01:43:00,909
appear - like the way inertia lead to

602
01:43:00,909 --> 01:43:03,429
creation and manifestation of the energy

603
01:43:03,429 --> 01:43:06,239
of the Universe in the gold or copper,

604
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:09,969
now we have learned how to manifest our

605
01:43:09,969 --> 01:43:14,020
guests. But, you can use the same process

606
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:18,790
to become part of, to join into the link

607
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:23,370
of the super-highway of the universe. Till

608
01:43:23,370 --> 01:43:26,889
your cousin or your son on planet Zeus

609
01:43:26,889 --> 01:43:29,139
has created a condition of the amino acid

610
01:43:29,139 --> 01:43:31,400
strength of your carbon-14,

611
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:37,080
which leads you to land there with him.

612
01:43:44,860 --> 01:43:48,770
Now you understand.

613
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:51,680
Because in that dimension, you travel

614
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:55,040
through the communication line of high-speed,

615
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:59,980
through, what we call, the soul speed of the man.

616
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:03,560
Because, it is still its combination of

617
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:06,560
amino acid but still is dynamic, that

618
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:14,360
it can link into. Now it's getting trickier,

619
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:17,960
isn't it?

620
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:33,610
Very, very tricky.

621
01:44:33,610 --> 01:44:38,469
Those of you who understood, those of you

622
01:44:38,469 --> 01:44:42,280
who maybe understand in the future,

623
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:54,880
I have already understood and you have

624
01:44:54,880 --> 01:45:04,709
already entered to produce the portals.

625
01:45:04,709 --> 01:45:16,260
But be careful when you do.

626
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:18,570
What did your mother say when you were

627
01:45:18,570 --> 01:45:22,400
young and you went on the street?

628
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:29,010
"Do not speak with the strangers, and do

629
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:31,530
not every time go out, come back home

630
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:42,180
with a cat and a dog." How many of you had

631
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:47,790
that? "Mum, it's the last, last cat I ever

632
01:45:47,790 --> 01:46:14,179
bring. I promise you that."

633
01:46:14,179 --> 01:46:23,400
Now we open you the portals,

634
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:29,590
who's gonna turn up,

635
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:34,100
and how would you have made the

636
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:40,070
confirmation and process of the soul

637
01:46:40,070 --> 01:47:32,719
level, which you have invited?

638
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:36,050
What does this mean to you, those of you

639
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:40,580
who were hoping that something might pop out

640
01:47:40,580 --> 01:48:02,689
of the jackpot?

641
01:48:02,689 --> 01:48:06,409
(RC) In the Q&A, Mr. Keshe, Dimitri mentiones,

642
01:48:06,409 --> 01:48:09,199
asked the question: "So when we use

643
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:11,709
the flight system of the soul of the man,

644
01:48:11,709 --> 01:48:15,199
we are using carbon-14 within ourselves?"

645
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:27,859
(MK) I don't know. What do you think?

646
01:48:27,859 --> 01:48:31,219
(RC) Well, he also followed up two minutes

647
01:48:31,219 --> 01:48:33,559
later with another question: "So, using

648
01:48:33,559 --> 01:48:37,369
carbon-14 within ourselves, is a result

649
01:48:37,369 --> 01:48:41,059
of conduct?" I think that's when you

650
01:48:41,059 --> 01:48:47,629
mentioned super-conduct-ivity.

651
01:48:47,629 --> 01:48:51,739
Is the use of carbon-14

652
01:48:51,739 --> 01:48:56,859
a result of conduct, in a way?

653
01:48:56,859 --> 01:48:59,780
It's kind of a play on words, but maybe

654
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:09,439
it's true. (MK) What a beautiful day.

655
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:12,109
We don't leave guess work, it's understanding

656
01:49:12,109 --> 01:49:19,950
and understanding the knowledge,

657
01:49:19,950 --> 01:49:25,840
comprehending the totality. This is what

658
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:34,189
it's about.

659
01:49:34,189 --> 01:49:57,350
it's about the total existence.

660
01:49:57,350 --> 01:50:03,890
(L) Oh mr. Kesh? (MK) Yes?

661
01:50:03,890 --> 01:50:07,010
(L) There is fantastic question... (MK) Would you like to

662
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:15,560
introduce yourself, please? We know who you are. (L) This is Ling, from

663
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:22,120
China, from the beautiful country and a

664
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:28,700
lot of people love you here.

665
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:32,330
Yes, I think you bring us so fantastic

666
01:50:32,330 --> 01:50:35,020
teaching today, but that's reminding me

667
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:39,970
of a video - what I watched before. It's about

668
01:50:39,970 --> 01:50:44,080
meditation from Buddhism teaching, and

669
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:49,160
from there, I remember it shows like a

670
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:54,710
white connection line, when the soul come

671
01:50:54,710 --> 01:50:58,850
out from the body and travel in the deep

672
01:50:58,850 --> 01:51:02,210
space. And it's always connected with the

673
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:04,630
physical body, so when you talk about

674
01:51:04,630 --> 01:51:10,570
carbon-14 I was thinking, maybe that is

675
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:15,830
carbon-14 field, inside the body and

676
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:20,870
that they find the match strength of the

677
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:23,840
Universe's carbon-14, and then the soul

678
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,510
just to travels outside of the body. Is

679
01:51:26,510 --> 01:51:35,930
that true? (MK) Yyymmm, the color of the brain of the

680
01:51:35,930 --> 01:51:39,350
man is a strange key to the color of the

681
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:50,850
soul.

682
01:51:50,850 --> 01:51:56,040
The... when we look at the structure of the

683
01:51:56,040 --> 01:52:08,010
brain, we see a very white color, cream-ish

684
01:52:08,010 --> 01:52:13,170
white color, and different points of the

685
01:52:13,170 --> 01:52:15,360
brain has slightly different

686
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:20,580
cream-ish white color, which is

687
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:25,550
combination of the magnesium and carbon

688
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:33,860
and zinc. Because, if you have made a

689
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:37,460
combination of the magnesium, zinc and

690
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:43,200
CO2 in GaNS, and you just change the

691
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:48,030
ratio slightly, you get a perfect,

692
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:51,000
perfect match of the structure of the

693
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,490
physicality of the brain of the man, in

694
01:52:53,490 --> 01:53:00,960
this dimension.

695
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:05,370
Has any of you ever made

696
01:53:05,370 --> 01:53:12,739
GaNS of silica?

697
01:53:12,739 --> 01:53:16,820
(JB) We've made a lot in Arizona. (MK) What color

698
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:26,150
is it? (JB) Tan. (MK) Pardon? (JB) Bright tan. (MK) Like what?

699
01:53:26,150 --> 01:53:38,929
(JB) Like a cream, cream color. (MK) Good morning. How

700
01:53:38,929 --> 01:53:45,610
many of you have made zinc GaNS?

701
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:49,820
(JB) Again, we made a lot of zinc. (MK) White-ish snow?

702
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:59,050
(JB) White-ish snow. (MK) CO2 is white-ish

703
01:53:59,050 --> 01:54:06,099
cream-ish, silica is white-ish cream--ish.

704
01:54:06,099 --> 01:54:12,739
Mr COHN, protein - transparent. Zinc -

705
01:54:12,739 --> 01:54:19,459
white-ish, cream-ish.

706
01:54:19,459 --> 01:54:24,029
Isn't the brain of the man, which holds

707
01:54:24,029 --> 01:54:28,519
the containment of the soul of the man,

708
01:54:28,519 --> 01:54:31,529
perfect match for man to become man of a

709
01:54:31,529 --> 01:55:02,989
space?

710
01:55:02,989 --> 01:55:17,600
Is this, or can we consider, as many of

711
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:20,830
you made, I presume the calcium GaNS too -

712
01:55:20,830 --> 01:55:25,430
what color is the calcium GaNS? (SK) White-ish, cream-ish.

713
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:37,490
(MK) Can I say good morning?

714
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:40,670
(SK) And calcium has also an isotope 42, which

715
01:55:40,670 --> 01:55:55,190
is stable. (MK) Good morning. Have we found the

716
01:55:55,190 --> 01:56:15,829
joint and balance connection, between both -

717
01:56:15,829 --> 01:56:18,829
the containment and control of the

718
01:56:18,829 --> 01:56:21,500
physicality of the man, the containment and

719
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:44,910
control of the soul of the man?

720
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:47,850
Has our soul been traveling on a

721
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:51,080
dimension of the physicality of the man,

722
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:55,770
and that's why we dream through our soul

723
01:56:55,770 --> 01:56:58,920
and it gets registered in the dimension

724
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:01,020
of understanding and memory of the

725
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:09,720
physicality of the man? Is the matter

726
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:13,410
state of the physicality of the man, the

727
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:19,590
copper? And the coating of it, of the same

728
01:57:19,590 --> 01:57:21,990
balance strength - the nano-coating,

729
01:57:21,990 --> 01:57:23,940
which creates the super conductivity through

730
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:49,090
dimension of the soul of man?

731
01:57:49,090 --> 01:57:52,150
Have we lived a double life in life of

732
01:57:52,150 --> 01:57:55,770
physicality, superseded or super covered

733
01:57:55,770 --> 01:57:59,110
by the dimension of the super

734
01:57:59,110 --> 01:58:01,119
conductivity on the level of one matter

735
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:03,190
state, which is connected to the universal

736
01:58:03,190 --> 01:58:09,400
dimension? Which is, our soul has

737
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:13,659
already been built, been developed, and

738
01:58:13,659 --> 01:58:16,900
been from the beginning on the direction

739
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:19,869
and in the presence of the soul of

740
01:58:19,869 --> 01:58:28,989
totality of the Universe? You know what a

741
01:58:28,989 --> 01:58:33,280
nano material is? Does not matter what,

742
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:40,640
the space gap is the same.

743
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:44,280
14, 14, 14 - it does not matter what material you

744
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:47,460
are. I spaced myself because I have a

745
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:49,050
field, which can link up with you in

746
01:58:49,050 --> 01:59:04,810
double and triple.

747
01:59:04,810 --> 01:59:08,690
Now half of the mystery of the life of

748
01:59:08,690 --> 01:59:15,770
the man, maybe is sorted. Maybe now you

749
01:59:15,770 --> 01:59:32,580
can understand,

750
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:38,940
how man has lived a double life.

751
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:44,730
Something, a mystery here.

752
02:00:44,730 --> 02:01:37,719
This, it sits 78.

753
02:01:37,719 --> 02:01:41,239
(RC) So, are you speaking about selenium in

754
02:01:41,239 --> 02:01:44,300
that case, mr. Keshe? With the 78, selenium

755
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:48,110
is 78.96, or

756
02:01:48,110 --> 02:01:54,980
something as it's weight. And selenium

757
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:58,250
is, I know, one of the essential elements

758
02:01:58,250 --> 02:02:01,909
for the body and is deficient in many

759
02:02:01,909 --> 02:02:05,360
soils - like in my local area, where I

760
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:17,260
happen to live? (MK) In your (...).

761
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:22,810
(RC) Sorry, pardon me. (MK) Explain.

762
02:02:22,810 --> 02:02:28,000
(RC) Well, I just know that there's a local

763
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,980
organic gardener and she's mentioned to

764
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:35,840
me that selenium is one of the essential

765
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:40,340
elements. We see, you know, iron of course

766
02:02:40,340 --> 02:02:44,840
is one, and of course the carbon, oxygen,

767
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:49,750
hydrogen and nitrogen; and I believe the

768
02:02:52,420 --> 02:02:57,469
silica, as well is one of the

769
02:02:57,469 --> 02:02:58,929
essentials.

770
02:02:58,929 --> 02:03:04,659
And the thing is that, I think due to

771
02:03:04,659 --> 02:03:09,230
certain conditions, local conditions, many

772
02:03:09,230 --> 02:03:14,420
soils can be depleted of selenium. So it

773
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:17,000
ends up if we don't get it from... (MK) Ok, we are looking

774
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:23,890
as 74, 78. (RC) 78, yeah. (MK) Yeah.

775
02:03:23,890 --> 02:03:27,679
(SK) It's five, five and half

776
02:03:27,679 --> 02:03:35,890
times 14. iIt's not a multiple of 14.

777
02:03:35,890 --> 02:03:40,340
It's an oddity because it's a little

778
02:03:40,340 --> 02:03:46,880
further from seventy. It's five and a

779
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:50,099
half times 14.

780
02:03:50,099 --> 02:03:53,730
(RC) So, we should, you mean it should be 56

781
02:03:53,730 --> 02:03:59,030
plus 14 to go to the next step? (MK) 70, yes.

782
02:03:59,030 --> 02:04:24,170
But now, if you look at 78... (SK) 70 + ???

783
02:04:24,170 --> 02:04:27,660
(MK) You see, if you have a 56 and you have

784
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:37,290
another 14, it gives you 70. But, if you go up,

785
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:45,050
do half of weight of the atomic mass of

786
02:04:45,050 --> 02:04:58,019
oxygen.

787
02:04:58,019 --> 02:05:00,540
Then

788
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:03,630
you get the combination, gravitational

789
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:06,030
field forces of this planet, which locks

790
02:05:06,030 --> 02:05:16,440
into it. Or, the other way if you look at

791
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:31,140
it - if you add part of magnetic field effect

792
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:43,040
of four oxygen, it's the same combination,

793
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:46,489
you will end up somewhere around the copper

794
02:05:46,489 --> 02:05:55,629
and zinc.

795
02:05:55,629 --> 02:06:00,769
If you take the combination mass

796
02:06:00,769 --> 02:06:04,519
elements of oxygen, which attracts

797
02:06:04,519 --> 02:06:07,309
and locks the man into the physicality of

798
02:06:07,309 --> 02:06:15,349
this Earth, that ties up the energy of

799
02:06:15,349 --> 02:06:17,149
the soul of the man to the physicality

800
02:06:17,149 --> 02:06:24,320
of this planet, which gravitational field,

801
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:25,909
magnetic field forces of the

802
02:06:25,909 --> 02:06:28,609
gravitational field of this planet, we

803
02:06:28,609 --> 02:06:34,669
always said is oxygen; you go four times

804
02:06:34,669 --> 02:06:41,869
16, then you see how zinc has become

805
02:06:41,869 --> 02:06:44,300
part of the structure of physicality of the

806
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:50,169
man. Then you see, through the carbon-14

807
02:06:50,169 --> 02:06:53,629
how the soul of the physicality of the

808
02:06:53,629 --> 02:06:55,909
man has got tangled into the

809
02:06:55,909 --> 02:06:57,679
gravitational field of the body of the

810
02:06:57,679 --> 02:07:02,389
man. And then, you can see how the soul of

811
02:07:02,389 --> 02:07:05,169
the physicality and the soul of the man,

812
02:07:05,169 --> 02:07:18,719
have got locked into each other.

813
02:07:18,719 --> 02:07:24,850
You don't understand - let me explain. Here,

814
02:07:24,850 --> 02:07:44,820
I have a next step, yeah? Sixty-eight.

815
02:07:44,820 --> 02:07:53,550
Here, I have

816
02:07:53,550 --> 02:08:04,320
(?) 64. (MK) Now, here I have the zinc,

817
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:08,079
connected to magnetic field,

818
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:10,719
gravitational field of the oxygen, which

819
02:08:10,719 --> 02:08:14,499
ties up with a gravitational-magnetic field

820
02:08:14,499 --> 02:08:16,960
element of non-ferro but in GaNS' state or

821
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:19,510
plasma state of 68 of the

822
02:08:19,510 --> 02:08:26,590
oxygen. Now you see, if I add the 14 here

823
02:08:26,590 --> 02:08:38,860
to it - how the whole structure locks into

824
02:08:38,860 --> 02:08:48,130
each other. Here,

825
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:51,999
you bring the emotion - dimensional

826
02:08:51,999 --> 02:09:04,110
of the control. Now you understand?

827
02:09:04,110 --> 02:09:08,530
Here. (JB) I think you drew that number of 68

828
02:09:08,530 --> 02:09:12,460
and I think it should be 64 up there, on top,

829
02:09:12,460 --> 02:09:24,270
where you circled. Should be 64. (MK) Ohh, yes 64, sorry.

830
02:09:24,270 --> 02:09:28,090
Now you understand how the physicality

831
02:09:28,090 --> 02:09:30,310
of the man, the soul of the man, and the

832
02:09:30,310 --> 02:09:32,860
connection between the soul and a

833
02:09:32,860 --> 02:09:35,170
physicality conductivity, have locked

834
02:09:35,170 --> 02:09:38,320
into each other. And why when you dream,

835
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:40,239
you remember in the physical dimension

836
02:09:40,239 --> 02:09:47,040
and you remember what the momma said.

837
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:50,080
And only happens in the dimension of

838
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:53,020
the magnetic field of the soul and the

839
02:09:53,020 --> 02:10:19,010
common denominator of the 14.

840
02:10:23,630 --> 02:10:29,070
Now, maybe you understand why we remember

841
02:10:29,070 --> 02:10:35,730
everything of our dreams. Because we

842
02:10:35,730 --> 02:10:39,900
bring it in, and we lock it in, into the

843
02:10:39,900 --> 02:11:05,800
physical dimension.

844
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:14,199
It is very, very easy to understand. Our

845
02:11:14,199 --> 02:11:17,559
man has got himself into the whole cycle

846
02:11:17,559 --> 02:11:20,170
of creation. The atmosphere of this

847
02:11:20,170 --> 02:11:22,300
planet has just created the condition,

848
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:25,480
and the availability of the field

849
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:37,499
forces. That's what has happened.

850
02:11:37,499 --> 02:11:39,880
Combination of the carbon-14 and a

851
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:42,999
carbon, in line of the connection with the

852
02:11:42,999 --> 02:11:45,610
physicality and everything else, has

853
02:11:45,610 --> 02:11:49,769
continuously has played back and forth.

854
02:11:49,769 --> 02:11:55,219
If you add six,

855
02:11:55,219 --> 02:11:57,980
or seven of the half of carbon, itself

856
02:11:57,980 --> 02:12:01,160
six to fourteen, you get twenty. What is

857
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:06,680
twenty? If you add half of the weight of

858
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:11,540
nitrogen to the nitrogen mass, which is

859
02:12:11,540 --> 02:12:15,400
seven, you get 21,22 -

860
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:24,500
sodium. And then you see how the

861
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:27,170
structure has picked up. How man

862
02:12:27,170 --> 02:12:28,930
has got trapped into the physicality,

863
02:12:28,930 --> 02:12:33,320
just by accidentally having creating a

864
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:36,380
condition. One, to the physical dimension

865
02:12:36,380 --> 02:12:38,920
of this magnetic field of this planet,

866
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:42,980
irrespective of its matter state, through its

867
02:12:42,980 --> 02:12:46,850
gaseous state, which is the oxygen. One,

868
02:12:46,850 --> 02:12:48,770
through the dimension of the matter

869
02:12:48,770 --> 02:12:50,989
state of this planet,

870
02:12:50,989 --> 02:12:55,160
which is through its carbon. And then, one in

871
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:56,900
the dimension of the strength of the

872
02:12:56,900 --> 02:12:59,989
work of the universe - communication or

873
02:12:59,989 --> 02:13:04,060
transportation line, which is carbon-14.

874
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:06,980
Man has always worked in all the three

875
02:13:06,980 --> 02:13:11,180
dimensions. Now you know why you remember

876
02:13:11,180 --> 02:13:14,270
your dreams. Why the color of the

877
02:13:14,270 --> 02:13:16,610
body, the soul of the man, contained with

878
02:13:16,610 --> 02:13:32,090
the white shade of the brain of the man.

879
02:13:32,090 --> 02:13:36,140
Everything else is matching up to fit in.

880
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:39,090
Everything else is there

881
02:13:39,090 --> 02:13:42,470
sitting - connection of the physicality,

882
02:13:42,470 --> 02:13:45,750
connection of the soul of the man, connection

883
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:48,600
with a matter state which is come, come...

884
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:51,920
in a way is a compromise between the two,

885
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:54,480
and a gravitational-magnetic field of

886
02:13:54,480 --> 02:14:05,950
this planet.

887
02:14:05,950 --> 02:14:10,700
Every half or a carbon addition to

888
02:14:10,700 --> 02:14:13,550
carbon-14, gives you connection with

889
02:14:13,550 --> 02:14:27,970
your physical dimension.

890
02:14:27,970 --> 02:14:32,170
Then you understand how the both

891
02:14:32,170 --> 02:14:35,360
magnetical, to do with the gravitational

892
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:38,150
field, to hold on to, in a dimension of

893
02:14:38,150 --> 02:14:40,940
the existence of the field of the plasma

894
02:14:40,940 --> 02:14:45,170
of the body, has led to creation of the

895
02:14:45,170 --> 02:14:46,850
same connection with universal

896
02:14:46,850 --> 02:14:52,720
communication line and magnetic field.

897
02:14:52,720 --> 02:14:55,490
One works in the dimension of

898
02:14:55,490 --> 02:14:58,370
physicality., one works in the dimension

899
02:14:58,370 --> 02:15:01,070
of the soul of the man, and one works in

900
02:15:01,070 --> 02:15:03,470
the dimension of the soul of the

901
02:15:03,470 --> 02:15:10,460
physicality. But the dimension of the

902
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:13,550
soul of the man and the dimension of the

903
02:15:13,550 --> 02:15:17,210
physicality of the man, sits in its

904
02:15:17,210 --> 02:15:19,460
dimension of the soul of the physicality,

905
02:15:19,460 --> 02:15:29,199
which is through the blood.

906
02:15:29,199 --> 02:15:38,610
That's how the link has been locked in.

907
02:15:38,610 --> 02:15:41,370
This is how the field moves from

908
02:15:41,370 --> 02:15:43,410
physicality dimension -

909
02:15:43,410 --> 02:15:55,999
the blood, the copper, the zinc.

910
02:15:55,999 --> 02:15:59,159
Now we can see the structure. Now we can

911
02:15:59,159 --> 02:16:01,860
see how we can travel in the dimension of

912
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:03,630
the physicality, or we can travel in the

913
02:16:03,630 --> 02:16:06,150
dimension of the soul of the man. If you bring

914
02:16:06,150 --> 02:16:08,429
the inertia condition of the

915
02:16:08,429 --> 02:16:10,320
gravitational field of the gaseous, which

916
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:11,969
we are totally in the plasma condition,

917
02:16:11,969 --> 02:16:14,489
which is oxygen - then we have the

918
02:16:14,489 --> 02:16:18,329
manifestation of the containment of the

919
02:16:18,329 --> 02:16:20,579
physicality of the soul of the man.

920
02:16:20,579 --> 02:16:24,599
Which is the zinc, which is the amino

921
02:16:24,599 --> 02:16:31,710
acid, which is silica, which is carbon-14,

922
02:16:31,710 --> 02:16:52,809
and a carbon.

923
02:16:52,809 --> 02:16:58,209
Now mankind should be very easy for it

924
02:16:58,209 --> 02:16:59,920
to understand, why even you dream,

925
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:03,309
and you remember your dream. Where it's

926
02:17:03,309 --> 02:17:05,230
actually its communication on the line

927
02:17:05,230 --> 02:17:11,010
of your soul, and you call the dream.

928
02:17:11,010 --> 02:17:15,520
Some of you have enough influence on the

929
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:18,459
transformation between the carbon and

930
02:17:18,459 --> 02:17:22,420
carbon-14, that you can even call it the

931
02:17:22,420 --> 02:17:29,440
wish, but in fact you have understood

932
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:37,450
how to tap in to the soul of the man. Now you

933
02:17:37,450 --> 02:17:40,120
understand when we were explaining how

934
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:42,340
you can control the space reactors with

935
02:17:42,340 --> 02:17:46,180
thoughts, with a wish - I want to go to the

936
02:17:46,180 --> 02:17:51,690
left.

937
02:17:51,690 --> 02:17:57,190
Good morning John!

938
02:17:57,190 --> 02:18:06,299
(JB) I'm awake and paying attention.

939
02:18:06,299 --> 02:18:12,209
(MK) What made you to make so much silica?

940
02:18:12,209 --> 02:18:17,099
(JB) Because right now our bodies are made

941
02:18:17,099 --> 02:18:20,799
carbon-based, and now I've heard a

942
02:18:20,799 --> 02:18:24,459
lot of talk in teachings about going to

943
02:18:24,459 --> 02:18:29,740
a crystalline based, which is silica. So,

944
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:34,440
now it starts to make sense, because I

945
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:40,388
can see where that silica is is, comes in

946
02:18:40,388 --> 02:18:48,580
the equation. (MK) But you can see how

947
02:18:48,580 --> 02:18:54,591
silica controls Mr. COHN?!

948
02:18:54,591 --> 02:19:03,389
(JB) Now I do. (MK) Now, does it mean that in

949
02:19:03,389 --> 02:19:07,910
your systems, you have to always consider

950
02:19:07,910 --> 02:19:18,020
to be connected to the use of amino acid.

951
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:21,180
(JB) We've always, we've always had.... everything

952
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:29,250
that we do, we connect the amino acids. (MK) You should be able to think and

953
02:19:29,250 --> 02:19:39,959
your system should fly.

954
02:19:39,959 --> 02:19:42,179
(JB) We just have to tweak a couple little

955
02:19:42,179 --> 02:19:45,920
things and we'll be right there.

956
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:50,450
(MK) A little tweaking to do?!

957
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:15,420
Now, hopefully we see, we understand.

958
02:20:15,420 --> 02:20:23,710
Why we dream in this level, but we live

959
02:20:23,710 --> 02:20:26,890
at this level.

960
02:21:44,050 --> 02:21:56,270
Now, where do you think a line of

961
02:21:56,270 --> 02:23:13,681
connection to the strength of the soul of the man sits?

962
02:23:13,681 --> 02:23:22,141
I'm still waiting. (JB) Right now it's a zinc -

963
02:23:22,141 --> 02:23:27,670
64, but it's along the pathway of

964
02:23:27,670 --> 02:23:52,650
carbon-14. Is the pathway to the soul.

965
02:23:52,650 --> 02:24:08,919
(AG) 9th.

966
02:24:08,919 --> 02:24:23,050
(MK) I'm waiting Armen. (AG) 14 times 9. (MK) Why nine?

967
02:24:23,050 --> 02:24:28,000
(AG) No, not 14 times 9. (MK) Yeah, why

968
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:47,351
nine times? (AG) It goes to iodine.

969
02:24:47,351 --> 02:24:49,601
(MK) Do you remember iodine, somewhere else

970
02:24:49,601 --> 02:24:58,420
we mentioned, years ago? (AG) Long time ago.

971
02:24:58,420 --> 02:25:01,280
(MK) Those who work out iodine, do you remember where it

972
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:10,760
came to?

973
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:15,470
(AG) What was the question? I couldn't hear. (MK) I

974
02:25:15,470 --> 02:25:19,561
said, do you remember what was number one

975
02:25:19,561 --> 02:25:27,150
iodine came to be? I think somebody

976
02:25:27,150 --> 02:25:29,521
worked out that should be the strength

977
02:25:29,521 --> 02:25:39,440
of the soul of the man?! (MK) Yes, you told us.

978
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:42,090
(RC) Yes, I remember that being mentioned as

979
02:25:42,090 --> 02:25:47,010
well.

980
02:25:54,359 --> 02:25:58,459
(AG) Is it correct? (MK) Very much so.

981
02:25:58,459 --> 02:26:02,009
But you understand the position of and a

982
02:26:02,009 --> 02:26:44,330
connection of with physicality. (AG) Now we do.

983
02:26:44,330 --> 02:26:46,870
(MK) Now a lot of mysteries comes together.

984
02:26:46,870 --> 02:26:50,990
You have to understand this, if you're

985
02:26:50,990 --> 02:26:55,250
going to play with portals. Are you moving

986
02:26:55,250 --> 02:26:56,180
the soul?

987
02:26:56,180 --> 02:27:01,359
Are you moving the physicality? Because,

988
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:12,460
if you take the element of iodine - 126 magnetic energy fields,

989
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:19,510
it's in fact, 11 times, 11.5 times, taking percentage

990
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:23,699
of field conductivity of the carbon,

991
02:27:23,699 --> 02:27:26,199
is around the interaction of the field

992
02:27:26,199 --> 02:27:29,350
forces of the matter state of the body

993
02:27:29,350 --> 02:27:36,881
of the man - which is carbon-12.

994
02:27:36,881 --> 02:27:39,190
This is where the soul of the man, connects

995
02:27:39,190 --> 02:27:43,570
to the physicality of the man, in the dimension

996
02:27:43,570 --> 02:27:48,070
of their strength. After two years, three years

997
02:27:48,070 --> 02:27:51,311
we just come back, to the same point again, but

998
02:27:51,311 --> 02:27:56,291
now we understand what we need.

999
02:27:56,291 --> 02:28:02,621
So, when you make your portals, the random

1000
02:28:02,621 --> 02:28:06,761
calculation is: how many times the

1001
02:28:06,761 --> 02:28:09,311
strength of the gravitational and

1002
02:28:09,311 --> 02:28:14,980
magnetical fields of carbon-14, gives you

1003
02:28:14,980 --> 02:28:18,131
the speed of the travel, in the dimension

1004
02:28:18,131 --> 02:28:23,081
of the lines of the transportation of

1005
02:28:23,081 --> 02:28:24,911
the lines of the fields of the Universe by

1006
02:28:24,911 --> 02:28:30,671
order of the magnitude. The speed of light

1007
02:28:30,671 --> 02:28:38,300
does not come into it anymore.

1008
02:28:38,300 --> 02:28:46,069
It's like they say, you have a yacht with

1009
02:28:46,069 --> 02:28:49,880
an engine, which can do.... or a boat with an

1010
02:28:49,880 --> 02:28:52,729
engine which can do hundred km/h,

1011
02:28:52,729 --> 02:28:56,479
but they don't tell you, the river

1012
02:28:56,479 --> 02:29:17,040
you are on is already traveling at 400.

1013
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:20,950
So, when it comes to measuring and

1014
02:29:20,950 --> 02:29:23,320
understanding the transportation through

1015
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:26,561
the dimension of the portal, or

1016
02:29:26,561 --> 02:29:30,311
dimension of the soul of the man; in so many

1017
02:29:30,311 --> 02:29:33,510
ways the dimension, multiple of

1018
02:29:33,510 --> 02:29:38,771
carbon-14, fits directly to the soul of the man.

1019
02:29:38,771 --> 02:29:41,771
In a way, if you look at it, you travel nine

1020
02:29:41,771 --> 02:29:46,930
times by speed, to the direction of

1021
02:29:46,930 --> 02:29:53,470
position. And then you can tighten it, by

1022
02:29:53,470 --> 02:29:55,870
the order of magnitude. This is the... We

1023
02:29:55,870 --> 02:29:57,970
are not talking about the speed of light.

1024
02:29:57,970 --> 02:30:15,540
Speed of light does not exist, it's only in the matter state. And it does not go trough phase-change. I was explaining that it in the teaching yesterday.

1025
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:18,130
Somebody said we go through another

1026
02:30:18,130 --> 02:30:21,940
dimension, and I explained that very, very

1027
02:30:21,940 --> 02:30:34,271
simply. I was explaining to a number of Iranian scientists this morning. When you travel

1028
02:30:34,271 --> 02:30:36,580
with the speed of sound and you break

1029
02:30:36,580 --> 02:30:40,181
the sound barrier, as you go through it.

1030
02:30:40,181 --> 02:30:45,070
The aircraft with a pilot, does it change

1031
02:30:45,070 --> 02:30:47,681
on the other side of the sound barrier?

1032
02:30:47,681 --> 02:30:49,990
Does it become a different aircraft, or

1033
02:30:49,990 --> 02:30:52,540
does it become different man? Sound barrier is

1034
02:30:52,540 --> 02:30:54,580
again, is a magnetic field compression -

1035
02:30:54,580 --> 02:30:57,101
even you call it the air compression. An air is

1036
02:30:57,101 --> 02:31:00,061
made of magnetic fields.

1037
02:31:00,061 --> 02:31:03,061
So, when the man goes through the speed

1038
02:31:03,061 --> 02:31:05,250
of light in the matter state, when he

1039
02:31:05,250 --> 02:31:07,620
does, would he come out to a new dimension?

1040
02:31:07,620 --> 02:31:11,070
Or as you pass, every time does the

1041
02:31:11,070 --> 02:31:13,230
pilot becomes a donkey, and the plane

1042
02:31:13,230 --> 02:31:14,851
becomes a monkey and everything else

1043
02:31:14,851 --> 02:31:30,300
changes, every time you pass through? So,

1044
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:35,210
you come to understand - you have found a way,

1045
02:31:35,210 --> 02:31:39,181
a measuring method. A way to be able

1046
02:31:39,181 --> 02:31:42,240
roughly guess, what speed you're

1047
02:31:42,240 --> 02:31:45,570
going to go, where are you going to go, and where

1048
02:31:45,570 --> 02:31:48,000
have you set the dimension to the amino acid

1049
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,980
strength of the soul of the man,

1050
02:31:49,980 --> 02:31:55,080
to land down where you want to be. You move the

1051
02:31:55,080 --> 02:32:06,570
man through the strength of his soul.

1052
02:32:35,620 --> 02:32:48,150
(RC) Hello Mr. Keshe?!

1053
02:32:48,150 --> 02:32:53,650
Oops, should be just another minute or two for Mr.

1054
02:32:53,650 --> 02:33:03,291
Keshe to come back. Bear with us please.

1055
02:33:03,291 --> 02:33:09,419
(MK) ... moved in the dimension of the

1056
02:33:09,419 --> 02:33:16,600
soul of the man and he moved on.

1057
02:33:16,600 --> 02:33:19,239
(AG) We couldn't hear anything before you

1058
02:33:19,239 --> 02:33:23,709
said. (MK) Those of you.... I didn't say anything, I

1059
02:33:23,709 --> 02:33:26,649
got dropped off. I'm just back. You have not

1060
02:33:26,649 --> 02:33:31,780
missed anything Armen'jan.

1061
02:33:31,780 --> 02:33:34,570
(AG) Okay. (MK) And I lost all my pictures, but it's

1062
02:33:34,570 --> 02:33:38,980
good. Now we understand the process, now

1063
02:33:38,980 --> 02:33:40,570
we start learning how to make the

1064
02:33:40,570 --> 02:34:03,980
framework.

1065
02:34:03,980 --> 02:34:06,040
You have to make a common denominator

1066
02:34:06,040 --> 02:34:10,160
framework, which allows and respects, not

1067
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:13,220
only the soul of the physicality - if you want

1068
02:34:13,220 --> 02:34:15,320
to go in the dimension of physicality -

1069
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:24,130
but respects the soul of the man too.

1070
02:34:24,130 --> 02:34:27,819
A strange thing is, not many creatures

1071
02:34:27,819 --> 02:34:30,710
have this combination to be able to

1072
02:34:30,710 --> 02:34:37,130
travel the span of Universe. Now you see

1073
02:34:37,130 --> 02:34:48,030
the advantage of being a human.

1074
02:34:48,030 --> 02:34:50,830
Very, very few races come to this

1075
02:34:50,830 --> 02:35:08,330
combination.

1076
02:35:08,330 --> 02:35:11,890
Now we start building a framework.

1077
02:35:11,890 --> 02:35:18,560
We start putting new rules, new dimensions....

1078
02:35:33,410 --> 02:35:49,601
which is actually.... CH3....

1079
02:35:57,961 --> 02:36:05,940
Then, then you understand, how close man is to

1080
02:36:05,940 --> 02:36:07,860
be able to become the passengers of the

1081
02:36:07,860 --> 02:36:40,539
Universe.

1082
02:36:40,539 --> 02:36:48,469
Any questions?

1083
02:36:48,469 --> 02:36:51,229
(RC) Ok, thank you Mr. Keshe, and once again I'll

1084
02:36:51,229 --> 02:36:54,409
remind the attendees, they can put their hand

1085
02:36:54,409 --> 02:37:00,189
up and we can recognize you to speak. And

1086
02:37:00,189 --> 02:37:07,100
panelists can do that as they see fit or put your hand up.

1087
02:37:07,100 --> 02:37:13,069
And, we have a.... one question particularly,

1088
02:37:13,069 --> 02:37:22,429
from Angelina, as you were in there. She says:

1089
02:37:22,429 --> 02:37:24,859
"It is interesting to think about the

1090
02:37:24,859 --> 02:37:28,520
ratio between those elements. Why did

1091
02:37:28,520 --> 02:37:32,469
you pick up these specific elements? Are

1092
02:37:32,469 --> 02:37:37,509
they the ones that (...) the whole human being? (MK) I

1093
02:37:37,509 --> 02:37:40,279
didn't pick up - the gravitational field

1094
02:37:40,279 --> 02:37:42,109
force of this planet has done for

1095
02:37:42,109 --> 02:37:46,279
billions of years. Because it has to work

1096
02:37:46,279 --> 02:37:55,579
in both dimensions. You know, it's very

1097
02:37:55,579 --> 02:37:57,469
easy. You have to understand, it's very

1098
02:37:57,469 --> 02:38:01,249
easy. Easier said and then in the past maybe

1099
02:38:01,249 --> 02:38:03,679
48 hours, I've repeated it two or three

1100
02:38:03,679 --> 02:38:13,310
times. You travel 24 hours a day, with the

1101
02:38:13,310 --> 02:38:21,829
speed of the planet, you...., of its own. You

1102
02:38:21,829 --> 02:38:29,509
travel with the speed of 10.000 to

1103
02:38:29,509 --> 02:38:33,429
be the passenger of this solar system.

1104
02:38:33,429 --> 02:38:38,449
You travel with a speed of 100.000

1105
02:38:38,449 --> 02:38:43,359
to be the passenger of the Galaxy.

1106
02:38:43,359 --> 02:38:46,339
And you travel with a speed of 1 billion

1107
02:38:46,339 --> 02:38:50,919
to be passenger of the Universe. And

1108
02:38:50,919 --> 02:38:56,449
every one of them, therefore has a field

1109
02:38:56,449 --> 02:39:16,800
force effect on the creation of the man.

1110
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:20,430
This is how, at the speed you travel,

1111
02:39:20,430 --> 02:39:23,489
the collision you create to lead to the

1112
02:39:23,489 --> 02:39:26,460
creation of. If the speed of this planet

1113
02:39:26,460 --> 02:39:31,140
was not 1500 or 1600, let's say, km/h

1114
02:39:31,140 --> 02:39:34,649
to create it's 24 hours, and you would have

1115
02:39:34,649 --> 02:39:37,800
traveled at 2200 rpm,

1116
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:45,569
otherwise we call it km/h, that your

1117
02:39:45,569 --> 02:39:51,840
day was, let's say, 16 or 15 hours or

1118
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:56,850
whatever it could be. Then that speed

1119
02:39:56,850 --> 02:40:05,430
dictates a different fields creation, in

1120
02:40:05,430 --> 02:40:09,060
respect to the atmosphere of this solar

1121
02:40:09,060 --> 02:40:14,420
system. And if that creates that speed,

1122
02:40:14,420 --> 02:40:17,220
which means should be another field

1123
02:40:17,220 --> 02:40:19,560
forces exerted by the Sun on the Earth,

1124
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:22,050
or the combination of mixture of the

1125
02:40:22,050 --> 02:40:25,710
Earth itself, or our annual rotation

1126
02:40:25,710 --> 02:40:29,869
becomes 200 days on the same orbit,

1127
02:40:29,869 --> 02:40:32,130
means we are playing fast.

1128
02:40:32,130 --> 02:40:34,489
It means, we create, we produce

1129
02:40:34,489 --> 02:40:37,619
interaction of different fields and the

1130
02:40:37,619 --> 02:40:40,619
structure will change on this planet. You

1131
02:40:40,619 --> 02:40:48,060
turn up a grinding stone, and you hold

1132
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:53,220
your knife fixed to the position. Does

1133
02:40:53,220 --> 02:40:57,770
it create the same spark at 1600, than

1134
02:40:57,770 --> 02:41:06,920
2200? It's totally different.

1135
02:41:06,920 --> 02:41:13,010
So, the environment of this Universe, the

1136
02:41:13,010 --> 02:41:15,080
speed of rotation of it, the speed of

1137
02:41:15,080 --> 02:41:16,699
rotation of the Earth, the speed of

1138
02:41:16,699 --> 02:41:20,930
rotation of the solar system - now we

1139
02:41:20,930 --> 02:41:23,090
understand has an effect on the

1140
02:41:23,090 --> 02:41:25,399
creation of elements, in the different

1141
02:41:25,399 --> 02:41:27,260
position of this solar system, or this

1142
02:41:27,260 --> 02:41:31,239
Universe, or this galaxy .And that

1143
02:41:31,239 --> 02:41:35,510
combination has it's enforcement on the

1144
02:41:35,510 --> 02:41:38,060
others. This is... go back to the teaching

1145
02:41:38,060 --> 02:41:41,659
past years, I keep on referring to many

1146
02:41:41,659 --> 02:41:46,729
times, in teachings, that we are not only we

1147
02:41:46,729 --> 02:41:50,359
get the, what you call, the fields or

1148
02:41:50,359 --> 02:41:53,540
radiation from the interaction of the

1149
02:41:53,540 --> 02:41:55,279
field of the Earth and Sun. We get

1150
02:41:55,279 --> 02:41:57,680
radiations, we get fields from outside

1151
02:41:57,680 --> 02:42:00,290
the solar system, which its interaction

1152
02:42:00,290 --> 02:42:06,890
affects our life. Other things affect us,

1153
02:42:06,890 --> 02:42:10,159
and it comes into it, it dictates part of

1154
02:42:10,159 --> 02:42:13,850
our structure. So, we are not just

1155
02:42:13,850 --> 02:42:16,370
connected to 24 hours field strength

1156
02:42:16,370 --> 02:42:18,529
of this planet, because now the field of

1157
02:42:18,529 --> 02:42:22,040
the Sun counts too. So, we have a common

1158
02:42:22,040 --> 02:42:24,140
denominator at the end of it, which is

1159
02:42:24,140 --> 02:42:26,989
carbon-14, which is again affects our

1160
02:42:26,989 --> 02:42:30,229
condition to the speed of the travel

1161
02:42:30,229 --> 02:42:33,050
of the matter,

1162
02:42:33,050 --> 02:42:35,569
I'm sorry, field strength of the soul

1163
02:42:35,569 --> 02:42:37,370
of the man. We call it a soul, but it's

1164
02:42:37,370 --> 02:42:40,370
the packages of the energy, which has in line

1165
02:42:40,370 --> 02:42:44,569
accepted to be in conjunction with the

1166
02:42:44,569 --> 02:42:54,390
fields of this planet.

1167
02:42:54,390 --> 02:42:57,479
You got to understand. very simple, very

1168
02:42:57,479 --> 02:43:03,840
simple principle, and that is: if we have

1169
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:08,459
no motors, that we don't have, we don't

1170
02:43:08,459 --> 02:43:11,279
see any motors rotating this planet. Then

1171
02:43:11,279 --> 02:43:15,930
we have no motors to rotate the galaxies

1172
02:43:15,930 --> 02:43:19,770
in the spans of the Universe - how

1173
02:43:19,770 --> 02:43:21,810
stronger the field strength of

1174
02:43:21,810 --> 02:43:25,619
carbon-14, or the winds of the Universe

1175
02:43:25,619 --> 02:43:28,590
has to be, that it can create such an

1176
02:43:28,590 --> 02:43:33,869
interaction, rotation with, and cause of

1177
02:43:33,869 --> 02:43:39,419
the galaxy to rotate? The speeds of the

1178
02:43:39,419 --> 02:43:44,119
fields of Universe are many multiple

1179
02:43:44,119 --> 02:43:55,409
larger, than one billion. How you get one

1180
02:43:55,409 --> 02:43:57,749
of these, what you call the windmills,

1181
02:43:57,749 --> 02:44:00,419
children windmills, and blow on it - it has

1182
02:44:00,419 --> 02:44:04,789
no motor. The speed you blow the air,

1183
02:44:04,789 --> 02:44:10,499
dictates how fast it goes. And, still

1184
02:44:10,499 --> 02:44:14,459
there is so much surplus energy, that the

1185
02:44:14,459 --> 02:44:17,369
speed of the blade cannot catch up with,

1186
02:44:17,369 --> 02:44:23,669
or is not enough. If the winds of the

1187
02:44:23,669 --> 02:44:27,749
Universe can create the galaxies to move

1188
02:44:27,749 --> 02:44:32,220
at 1 million km/h, how

1189
02:44:32,220 --> 02:44:36,209
stronger they are, that in slowing down

1190
02:44:36,209 --> 02:44:38,669
in the interaction matter states, they

1191
02:44:38,669 --> 02:44:40,739
create? This goes back to what I keep on

1192
02:44:40,739 --> 02:44:45,029
saying, that no man has ever managed to

1193
02:44:45,029 --> 02:44:47,579
measure the speed of magnetic fields.

1194
02:44:47,579 --> 02:44:51,060
Be it in the matter state, be it in the

1195
02:44:51,060 --> 02:44:53,760
speed of the universal magnetic

1196
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:56,609
fields. Then you can travel the speed of

1197
02:44:56,609 --> 02:44:59,909
the universe, at any speed depending what

1198
02:44:59,909 --> 02:45:06,960
you lock in yourself to, for what reason.

1199
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:15,851
Then it's not 9 times, is order of

1200
02:45:15,851 --> 02:45:19,870
magnitude 9 times the speed of universal

1201
02:45:19,870 --> 02:45:23,290
magnetic fields. Because that energy of

1202
02:45:23,290 --> 02:45:27,010
the extra Neutron, is dictated and

1203
02:45:27,010 --> 02:45:30,090
controlled by the universal field forces.

1204
02:45:30,090 --> 02:45:38,830
Has no friction. Is purely on a speed of

1205
02:45:38,830 --> 02:45:42,370
the center, the principle matter speeds

1206
02:45:42,370 --> 02:45:59,890
of itself.

1207
02:45:59,890 --> 02:46:03,859
It's not anymore the order of, what you

1208
02:46:03,859 --> 02:46:05,509
call it - multiplication, it is in order of

1209
02:46:05,509 --> 02:46:08,859
magnitude. Then you understand, man,

1210
02:46:08,859 --> 02:46:13,459
that a speed of the carbon-14, must be

1211
02:46:13,459 --> 02:46:15,949
dictated by a higher speed of order from

1212
02:46:15,949 --> 02:46:21,650
outside the Universe.

1213
02:46:21,650 --> 02:46:25,640
Which condition of it, part of it, is

1214
02:46:25,640 --> 02:46:29,210
connected to the speed of the travel of

1215
02:46:29,210 --> 02:46:43,680
the soul of the Creator?

1216
02:46:43,680 --> 02:46:47,229
Then, can we create a portal, that can

1217
02:46:47,229 --> 02:46:49,539
attract the travelers of different

1218
02:46:49,539 --> 02:47:10,041
universes?

1219
02:47:10,041 --> 02:47:33,591
Now I hope, I hope you understand.

1220
02:47:33,591 --> 02:47:37,830
(RC) Mr. Keshe, Doug had asked in the Q&A earlier:

1221
02:47:37,830 --> 02:47:44,030
"Is this pure spiritual/plasma science

1222
02:47:44,030 --> 02:47:46,860
extending into the matter state science,

1223
02:47:46,860 --> 02:47:50,641
to help us combine the two dimensions?"

1224
02:47:50,641 --> 02:48:14,570
(MK) Good morning.

1225
02:48:14,570 --> 02:48:19,670
(RC) And we have a question from Christian, in

1226
02:48:19,670 --> 02:48:23,210
the Q&A: "I am passing on the question by

1227
02:48:23,210 --> 02:48:27,500
Holger, who cannot

1228
02:48:27,500 --> 02:48:32,030
attend. Can you please give us practical

1229
02:48:32,030 --> 02:48:34,900
advice and training, on how to use

1230
02:48:34,900 --> 02:48:38,630
emotions for communication with our soul,

1231
02:48:38,630 --> 02:48:47,800
or Soul?" (MK) Find a common denominator,

1232
02:48:47,800 --> 02:48:56,720
between the strength of the soul, line of

1233
02:48:56,720 --> 02:49:01,540
communication and the strength of matter

1234
02:49:01,540 --> 02:49:09,470
line of communication. It's somewhere

1235
02:49:09,470 --> 02:49:21,900
around 160,

1236
02:49:21,900 --> 02:49:24,971
which is ten times the magnetic

1237
02:49:24,971 --> 02:49:34,351
gravitational field of the, what do you call it,

1238
02:49:34,351 --> 02:49:41,051
oxygen, gravitational field of oxygen. If

1239
02:49:41,051 --> 02:49:43,571
you multiply 12 by 14 gives you

1240
02:49:43,571 --> 02:49:56,161
something like 166. And then, you have

1241
02:49:56,161 --> 02:49:59,411
somewhere between that and then

1242
02:49:59,411 --> 02:50:01,241
somewhere with iodine - which is a soul

1243
02:50:01,241 --> 02:50:03,071
of the man with the dimension of

1244
02:50:03,071 --> 02:50:05,741
containment of the strength of it. Now

1245
02:50:05,741 --> 02:50:08,171
you know the strength of it,. To contain

1246
02:50:08,171 --> 02:50:14,621
it, you have to be higher. Dividing what is 126, you

1247
02:50:14,621 --> 02:50:17,081
have to give a stronger cage, that you

1248
02:50:17,081 --> 02:50:22,811
can contain it - which is 166. If it is lower, it

1249
02:50:22,811 --> 02:50:29,111
escapes. And, if you find a combination of

1250
02:50:29,111 --> 02:50:33,971
the elements of, in so many ways, the

1251
02:50:33,971 --> 02:50:41,111
totality of the structure, which is, in so

1252
02:50:41,111 --> 02:50:49,900
many ways.... very, very much the containment

1253
02:50:49,900 --> 02:51:02,930
of the amino acid of the man.

1254
02:51:02,930 --> 02:51:06,409
Then it gives you the dimension of the

1255
02:51:06,409 --> 02:51:08,680
existence, taking into consideration

1256
02:51:08,680 --> 02:51:11,479
possibilities of all the fields. Because,

1257
02:51:11,479 --> 02:51:23,770
if you multiply 42, 43 by four times,

1258
02:51:23,770 --> 02:51:29,470
it gives you how it comes to be part of

1259
02:51:29,470 --> 02:51:31,150
the structure of the creation of the

1260
02:51:31,150 --> 02:51:51,390
matter state of the brain of the man.

1261
02:51:51,390 --> 02:52:01,561
Now a lot of things fits, doesn't it?

1262
02:52:01,561 --> 02:52:04,510
Now maybe you understand why we even have

1263
02:52:04,510 --> 02:52:19,570
a calcium scull?!

1264
02:52:19,570 --> 02:52:24,300
This is how, you understand why we have,

1265
02:52:24,300 --> 02:52:31,810
they find carbon-14 even in our bones. It

1266
02:52:31,810 --> 02:52:34,060
comes from the universal field forces,

1267
02:52:34,060 --> 02:52:38,350
not from the body of the man. And it's got

1268
02:52:38,350 --> 02:52:41,110
such a lapse, such a strength, that it is

1269
02:52:41,110 --> 02:52:45,070
easy to travel. It's a foreigner, it's out

1270
02:52:45,070 --> 02:52:47,040
of this world,

1271
02:52:47,040 --> 02:52:49,390
but it's part of the common denominator,

1272
02:52:49,390 --> 02:52:51,490
and has dictated the structure of the

1273
02:52:51,490 --> 02:52:58,119
man.

1274
02:52:58,119 --> 02:53:04,210
It's dynamic, but has a, what we call, a

1275
02:53:04,210 --> 02:53:07,869
beta-effect - as we call it. So it means, it

1276
02:53:07,869 --> 02:53:14,021
interacts with the matter state.

1277
02:53:14,021 --> 02:53:16,649
So,

1278
02:53:16,649 --> 02:53:19,530
calcium can block it, can hold it, can

1279
02:53:19,530 --> 02:53:26,970
contain it.

1280
02:53:26,970 --> 02:53:29,430
When you look at the brain of the man

1281
02:53:29,430 --> 02:53:32,060
you understand about the soul of the man,

1282
02:53:32,060 --> 02:53:35,579
and the creation of the physicality of

1283
02:53:35,579 --> 02:53:43,829
it. It creates a field force pull, that it

1284
02:53:43,829 --> 02:53:48,940
becomes part of its cycle.

1285
02:53:48,940 --> 02:53:58,980
[Now I have to teach something very, very strange but it's beautiful if you understand it.]

1286
02:53:58,980 --> 02:54:01,771
Man will understand how he's come to be

1287
02:54:01,771 --> 02:54:07,200
created.Yellow or this way. Okay,

1288
02:54:07,200 --> 02:54:09,210
let's look at something. Sorry about

1289
02:54:09,210 --> 02:54:13,080
this, I don't have my pen. I said will

1290
02:54:13,080 --> 02:54:15,300
it next week, to be able to make it.

1291
02:54:15,300 --> 02:54:19,681
This is your one part of your brain, this

1292
02:54:19,681 --> 02:54:24,090
is one part of your brain. This is what

1293
02:54:24,090 --> 02:54:31,050
you have as a beautiful soul. Sorry,

1294
02:54:31,050 --> 02:54:33,900
it's too powerful. You got to understand,

1295
02:54:33,900 --> 02:54:39,271
this little chap is dynamic, and now you

1296
02:54:39,271 --> 02:54:43,050
understand the strength of it. But, it

1297
02:54:43,050 --> 02:54:46,290
creates a gravitational-magnetic field

1298
02:54:46,290 --> 02:54:51,500
forces, which is equal, the same as you

1299
02:54:51,500 --> 02:54:55,891
extracted CO2 from the environment, very

1300
02:54:55,891 --> 02:54:59,820
much... I cannot do it as a white color, I use

1301
02:54:59,820 --> 02:55:04,200
yellow color, it gives you, it pulls in

1302
02:55:04,200 --> 02:55:09,150
and it creates your skull - calcium - due to

1303
02:55:09,150 --> 02:55:12,061
it's forces. But as the calcium comes

1304
02:55:12,061 --> 02:55:15,570
and sits, and finds its position, like the

1305
02:55:15,570 --> 02:55:19,670
crust of the Earth. Now, very much like a

1306
02:55:19,670 --> 02:55:25,380
dynamic lava, it grinds on it, and it

1307
02:55:25,380 --> 02:55:28,440
continuously feed itself from it, that

1308
02:55:28,440 --> 02:55:33,271
it falls in and it creates the seed of

1309
02:55:33,271 --> 02:55:41,940
the physicality of the brain of the man. But it's

1310
02:55:41,940 --> 02:55:45,120
pull gets it, continuously extending on

1311
02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:49,200
it, but inside grinds it, to get the

1312
02:55:49,200 --> 02:56:00,790
strength that it needs for its existence.

1313
02:56:00,790 --> 02:56:03,819
We look at the physicality of the brain,

1314
02:56:03,819 --> 02:56:07,040
but how come it's got that shape? There is a

1315
02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:10,790
magnetic field flow wind - as you call it

1316
02:56:10,790 --> 02:56:18,739
here. And what strength it creates and

1317
02:56:18,739 --> 02:56:20,960
it has, dictates the shape of this

1318
02:56:20,960 --> 02:56:22,329
wind.

1319
02:56:22,329 --> 02:56:25,310
This is like, when we give a water to

1320
02:56:25,310 --> 02:56:28,100
somebody, and we tell them: this is a

1321
02:56:28,100 --> 02:56:29,869
water but it's GaNS,

1322
02:56:29,869 --> 02:56:33,020
it has, it's not normal water, it has a

1323
02:56:33,020 --> 02:56:35,050
field around it.

1324
02:56:35,050 --> 02:56:39,590
- Excuse me sir, this is GaNS too, hyh? And your

1325
02:56:39,590 --> 02:56:41,899
soul is contained within the structure

1326
02:56:41,899 --> 02:56:44,119
of the GaNS, it has a wind around it too.

1327
02:56:44,119 --> 02:56:46,939
So it grinds to it, it releases field

1328
02:56:46,939 --> 02:57:07,859
forces of it. Now you might understand a little bit more.

1329
02:57:07,859 --> 02:57:13,380
Don't forget - read book number one. At

1330
02:57:13,380 --> 02:57:16,410
what point, or read number, book number

1331
02:57:16,410 --> 02:57:18,540
three, or very well explained in number

1332
02:57:18,540 --> 02:57:25,260
four. That, how the surface of this planet,

1333
02:57:25,260 --> 02:57:29,399
or any planet has decided. So, a skull of

1334
02:57:29,399 --> 02:57:33,870
the man is the same. It's the interaction

1335
02:57:33,870 --> 02:57:36,140
gravitational-magnetic field of the soul

1336
02:57:36,140 --> 02:57:39,930
in a different strength of itself, gives

1337
02:57:39,930 --> 02:57:42,590
the dimension of the brain. With its

1338
02:57:42,590 --> 02:57:47,250
atmosphere, gives the skull of the man.

1339
02:57:47,250 --> 02:57:50,490
And where it's lost it, has found a loophole,

1340
02:57:50,490 --> 02:57:53,250
or leak on it - it becomes the spine of

1341
02:57:53,250 --> 02:58:00,109
the man. And then you get legs and arms. And

1342
02:58:00,109 --> 02:58:03,450
then you get what you have to deal with,

1343
02:58:03,450 --> 02:58:11,850
with the physical part of this planet.

1344
02:58:11,850 --> 02:58:16,380
And beautifully covers the soul of the

1345
02:58:16,380 --> 02:58:18,960
man in it, through the dimension of physicality,

1346
02:58:18,960 --> 02:58:43,740
but we call it a neurosystem.

1347
02:58:43,740 --> 02:58:47,440
We are reaching,gradually, the point of

1348
02:58:47,440 --> 02:58:52,021
departure. We're all on the same train,

1349
02:58:52,021 --> 02:59:00,101
and we are getting to the terminal. In

1350
02:59:00,101 --> 02:59:04,930
this city: the airports, the train station,

1351
02:59:04,930 --> 02:59:14,860
the bus station, the taxis - all go from

1352
02:59:14,860 --> 02:59:18,760
the same destination. You're in a hurry,

1353
02:59:18,760 --> 02:59:24,311
you have the money, you fly. You're in a

1354
02:59:24,311 --> 02:59:27,570
hurry but you have time, you get a train.

1355
02:59:27,570 --> 02:59:30,040
You're in a hurry but you don't have

1356
02:59:30,040 --> 02:59:34,180
that much, you get a bus. But you can go

1357
02:59:34,180 --> 02:59:38,320
on your own, you get a taxi. You want to

1358
02:59:38,320 --> 02:59:40,330
travel with the speed of the soul, you

1359
02:59:40,330 --> 02:59:41,710
want to travel with the speed of

1360
02:59:41,710 --> 02:59:44,320
Universe, you want to travel as a

1361
02:59:44,320 --> 02:59:46,180
sightseer: "I would like to be on the

1362
02:59:46,180 --> 02:59:50,170
spaceship" - now it's the choice of the man. And I

1363
02:59:50,170 --> 02:59:53,230
have taught you all of it now, maybe a

1364
02:59:53,230 --> 03:00:05,140
little bit is still left.

1365
03:00:05,140 --> 03:00:08,271
With the spaceship, with the reactors,

1366
03:00:08,271 --> 03:00:11,360
with the cores - we showed you, if you would

1367
03:00:11,360 --> 03:00:12,561
like to go with a donkey.

1368
03:00:12,561 --> 03:00:15,561
Get sightseer, you have all the time in

1369
03:00:15,561 --> 03:00:17,630
the world - you want to get up, you want to

1370
03:00:17,630 --> 03:00:22,850
go?! It's your choice! You want to go fast,

1371
03:00:22,850 --> 03:00:25,490
it's too far - you can take a jumbo-jet

1372
03:00:25,490 --> 03:00:27,080
and go through the dimension of the soul,

1373
03:00:27,080 --> 03:00:29,180
but you have to understand. I told you,

1374
03:00:29,180 --> 03:00:31,040
when I take man to a space, I take him

1375
03:00:31,040 --> 03:00:32,870
not as a subordinate, but total

1376
03:00:32,870 --> 03:00:41,030
knowledge. It's his choice. I'm not

1377
03:00:41,030 --> 03:00:42,771
interested in building factories and

1378
03:00:42,771 --> 03:00:45,890
companies and whatever. I'm interested to

1379
03:00:45,890 --> 03:00:48,380
take the man, but sometimes I have to

1380
03:00:48,380 --> 03:00:50,870
bribe this little chap with some sweetie

1381
03:00:50,870 --> 03:00:54,740
somewhere - just to get him to the line

1382
03:00:54,740 --> 03:01:02,800
that he can decide and it's there.

1383
03:01:02,800 --> 03:01:06,730
There is another flight system but I

1384
03:01:06,730 --> 03:01:09,521
introduce you to carbon-14 dimension.

1385
03:01:09,521 --> 03:01:12,550
There is a much, much faster way than

1386
03:01:12,550 --> 03:01:14,250
this

1387
03:01:14,250 --> 03:01:19,290
but in time, when man (is) educated, we teach more.

1388
03:01:19,290 --> 03:01:22,030
But this is good enough - you are traveling

1389
03:01:22,030 --> 03:01:25,150
millions of times by the order of

1390
03:01:25,150 --> 03:01:27,250
magnitude of the speed of light, the guy said

1391
03:01:27,250 --> 03:01:39,609
we cannot travel.

1392
03:01:39,609 --> 03:01:42,380
Now you understand how fast the

1393
03:01:42,380 --> 03:01:45,499
knowledge is getting transferred. Most of

1394
03:01:45,499 --> 03:01:47,210
it you do not understand, because the

1395
03:01:47,210 --> 03:01:49,279
comprehension of totality is not there.

1396
03:01:49,279 --> 03:01:51,499
But most of it, as I said, we teach not

1397
03:01:51,499 --> 03:01:54,289
through the voice but the soul of the man

1398
03:01:54,289 --> 03:01:56,630
for the others, and in the future man

1399
03:01:56,630 --> 03:01:59,029
will understand - if you don't forget it and

1400
03:01:59,029 --> 03:02:01,220
just make a pyramid, then you forgot how

1401
03:02:01,220 --> 03:02:06,020
it works, huh? It's no good having the most

1402
03:02:06,020 --> 03:02:09,649
advanced washing machine in the house,

1403
03:02:09,649 --> 03:02:11,390
when you lost the manual, you don't know how

1404
03:02:11,390 --> 03:02:15,920
to operate it, huh? Keep the manual, learn

1405
03:02:15,920 --> 03:02:19,460
the teachings and then you decide - you can wash

1406
03:02:19,460 --> 03:02:20,390
it with your hand,

1407
03:02:20,390 --> 03:02:27,510
or you can put in on a high-speed clean.

1408
03:02:27,510 --> 03:02:29,931
Just don't lose the manual, because

1409
03:02:29,931 --> 03:02:33,660
suddenly say: "Oh the guy said that, a

1410
03:02:33,660 --> 03:02:38,370
thousand years ago"; I hope it won't be that long for mankind, but I showed

1411
03:02:38,370 --> 03:02:40,260
you how you can extend your life, if you

1412
03:02:40,260 --> 03:02:42,061
want to have a thousand years, just to

1413
03:02:42,061 --> 03:02:46,230
mess around. And if you're like Armen,

1414
03:02:46,230 --> 03:02:59,750
you want it yesterday.
